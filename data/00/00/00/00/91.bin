00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,140

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,410
这并非战舰
This is not a warcraft.

34

我重复  这并非战舰
I repeat, this is not a warcraft.

35
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,330
听我说  你们应当开心
Hear me and rejoice.

36
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,750
你们有幸
You have had the privilege

37
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,170
被伟大泰坦所拯救
of being saved by the Great Titan.

38
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,850
你们或许觉得这是苦难
You may think this is suffering.

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,010
不是的
No.

40
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,180
这是拯救
It is salvation.

41
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,290
因为你们的牺牲
Universal scales tip toward balance

42
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,320
宇宙的天平又平衡了一些
because of your sacrifice.

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,860
笑笑吧
Smile.

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,780
即便是死了
For even in death,

45
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,410
你们也成为了灭霸的孩子
you have become Children of Thanos.

46
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,760
我懂得失败的感觉
I know what it's like to lose.

47
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,480
明明深切地知道你是对的
To feel so desperately that you're right...

48
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,810
却还是失败了
yet to fail, nonetheless.

49
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,660
是很可怕
It's frightening.

50
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,280
让人的腿发软
Turns the legs to jelly.

51
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,160
但我问你  这又何必
But I ask you, to what end?

52
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,880
害怕  逃避
Dread it, run from it...

53
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,880
命运总会到来
destiny arrives all the same.

54
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,050
现在  它来了
And now, it's here.

55
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,340
或者我该说
Or should I say...

56
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,390
我来了
I am.

57
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,350
你话太多了
You talk too much.

58
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,810
宇宙魔方
The Tesseract.

59
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,270
换你哥哥的脑袋
Or your brother's head.

60
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,070
你应该有所取舍吧
I assume you have a preference.

61
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,910
当然
Oh, I do.

62
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,580
杀了他吧
Kill away.

63
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,050
好吧  住手
All right, stop!

64
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,490
宇宙魔方不在我们这儿
We don't have the Tesseract.

65
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,480
它在阿斯加德上被毁了
It was destroyed on Asgard.

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,240
你真是最差劲的弟弟
You really are the worst brother.

67
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,410
我向你保证  哥哥
I assure you, brother...

68
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,080
我们还会时来运转的
the sun will shine on us again.

69
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,300
你的乐观用错了地方  阿斯加德人
Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

70
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,220
首先  我不是阿斯加德人
Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian.

71
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,800
另外
And for another...

72
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,180
我们有绿巨人
we have a Hulk.

73
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,150
让他玩吧
Let him have his fun.

74
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,830
众神之父
Allfathers...

75
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,210
让黑暗魔法最后一次
let the dark magic flow through me one last...

76
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,710
流过我
time.

77
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,560
那是个错误
That was a mistake.

78
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,950
不
No!

79
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,790
我会要你偿命的
You're going to die for that.

80
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,930
卑微的我
My humble personage...

81
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,730
向您的伟大臣服
bows before your grandeur.

82
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,980
从没有过什么人  如此强大
No other being has ever had the might...

83
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,980
如此崇高
nay, the nobility...

84
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,160
能够操控不仅一枚  而是两枚无限宝石的力量
to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones.

85
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,910
宇宙已经唾手可得
The universe lies within your grasp.

86
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,830
地球上还有两颗
There are two more stones on Earth.

87
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,920
找到它们  我的孩子  带去泰坦星上给我
Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

88
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,940
父亲  我们不会辜负你的
Father, we will not fail you.

89
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,090
容我插嘴
If I might interject.

90
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,880
如果你们要去地球  你们或许需要向导
If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide.

91
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,220
我在这方面还有点经验
I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

92
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,950
如果你认为失败也算经验的话
If you consider failure experience.

93
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,770
我认为经验就是经验
I consider experience experience.

94
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,400
全能的灭霸
Almighty Thanos...

95
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,350
我  洛基  阿斯加德王子
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

96
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,110
奥丁森
Odinson...

97
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,250
约顿海姆的合法国王
the rightful king of Jotunheim...

98
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,960
恶作剧之神
god of mischief...

99
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,750
在此向你宣誓
do hereby pledge to you...

100
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,340
不死的忠诚
my undying fidelity.

101
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,640
不死
Undying?

102
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,940
你措辞该更小心点的
You should choose your words more carefully.

103
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,090
你
You...

104
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,010
永远不会成为
will never be...

105
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,840
神
a god.

106
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,230
不
No!

107
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,500
这次别想复活了
No resurrections this time.

108
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,400
不  洛基
No. Loki.

109
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,150
你真的一点钱都没有吗
Seriously, you don't have any money?

110
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,540
对物质的依恋  就是与精神的断层
Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

111
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,920
我会把这话告诉熟食店的人的
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

112
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,010
或许他们能给你做个形而上的黑面包火腿三明治
Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

113
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,970
等等  我好像有两百
Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.

114
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,830
美元吗
Dollars?

115
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,450
-卢比  -那是多少
- Rupees. - Which is?

116
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,370
1.5美元
Buck and a half.

117
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,540
你想要什么
What do you want?

118
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,960
金枪鱼三明治倒是不错
I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

119
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,600
灭霸要来了
Thanos is coming.

120
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,600
他要来了
He's coming.

121
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,770
谁
Who?

122
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,210
慢点  慢点
Slow down, slow down.

123
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,470
-我解释给你听  -你在说胡话呢
- I'll spell it out for you. - You're totally rambling.

124
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,430
-没有啦  -我没听懂
- No, I'm not. - You lost me.

125
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,090
你知道那种  做梦的时候
Look, you know how you're having a dream,

126
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,220
觉得要上厕所的感觉吧
and in the dream you gotta pee.

127
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,390
-嗯  -好
- Yeah. - Okay.

128
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,470
然后你会发现  "天呐
And then you're like, "Oh, my God.

129
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,220
怎么到处都没厕所  怎么办啊
"There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do?

130
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,070
-有人在看啊"  -是啊
- "Oh, someone's watching." - Right.

131
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,390
-"我要尿裤子了"  -然后你醒过来
- "Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants." - And then you wake up

132
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,140
发现你其实是真想尿尿
and in real life you actually have to pee.

133
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,400
-没错  -嗯
- Yes. - Yeah.

134
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,650
-好  -每个人都做这种梦
- Okay. - Everybody has that.

135
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,470
是啊  这就是我想说的
Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.

136
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,760
关于这一点  昨晚  我梦到我们生了个孩子
Apropos of that, last night I dreamt we had a kid.

137
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,390
感觉可真了
It was so real.

138
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,660
我们还以一个奇怪的叔叔给他起了名
We named him after your eccentric uncle.

139
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,530
他叫什么来着
Uh, what was his name?

140
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,560
-哦  -摩根  摩根
- Right. - Morgan! Morgan.

141
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,910
-于是你醒来  -当然了
- So you woke up... - Naturally.

142
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,190
觉得我们...
...and thought that we were...

143
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,750
-要有了  -嗯
- Expecting. - Yeah.

144
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,710
-有吗  -没有
- Yes? - No.

145
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,290
我梦到了  可真了
I had a dream about it. It was so real.

146
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,650
如果你想要孩子
If you wanted to have a kid...

147
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,570
你就不会这么做了
you wouldn't have done that.

148
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,340
我很高兴你提到了这个  因为这没什么
I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing.

149
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,050
就是纳米粒子的储存器
It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.

150
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,380
这话是帮倒忙
You're not helping your case, okay?

151
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,840
不  这是能拆掉的
No, this is detachable. It's not a...

152
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,250
你不需要它
You don't need that.

153
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,560
我知道  我做了手术
I know, I had the surgery.

154
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,040
我就是想保护我们
I'm just trying to protect us...

155
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,810
还有未来更多的我们什么的
and future usses and that's it.

156
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,690
以防衣橱里藏了怪物
Just in case there's a monster in the closet.

157
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,460
-而不是  -衬衫
- Instead of, you know... - Shirts.

158
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,190
你好了解我
You know me so well.

159
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,010
-天呐  -你还能接我的话
- God. - You finish all my sentences.

160
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,100
你的衣橱里该放衬衣
You should have shirts in your closet.

161
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,890
是啊
Yeah.

162
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,870
知道该有什么吗  再不制造意外了
You know what there should be? No more surprises.

163
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,240
我们今晚好好吃顿晚饭
We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

164
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,060
炫耀下这枚海瑞温斯顿的钻戒
Show off this Harry Winston.

165
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,960
是吧  今后再不制造什么意外了
Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever.

166
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,170
我要向你保证
I should promise you.

167
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,440
-好  -真的
- Yes. - I will.

168
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,860
谢谢
Thank you.

169
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,820
托尼·斯塔克
Tony Stark.

170
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,620
我是斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士  我需要你跟我来
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me.

171
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,830
恭喜你们要结婚了
Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

172
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,080
抱歉  你是卖票的吗
I'm sorry, you giving out tickets to something?

173
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,210
我们需要你帮忙
We need your help.

174
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,600
可以不夸张地说
It's not overselling it to say that

175
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
这事关全宇宙的命运
the fate of the universe is at stake.

176
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
"我们"是谁
And who's "we"?

177
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,800
托尼
Hey, Tony.

178
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,840
布鲁斯
Bruce.

179
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,050
派珀
Pepper.

180
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,930
你没事吧
You okay?

181
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,270
宇宙之初
At the dawn of the universe,

182
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,730
是一片虚无  然后...
there was nothing. Then...

183
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,240
大爆炸把六颗元素水晶
The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals...

184
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,740
抛到了新宇宙的深处
hurtling across the virgin universe.

185
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,510
这些无限宝石
These Infinity Stones

186
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,580
每一颗都控制一种存在的基本方面
each control an essential aspect of existence.

187
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,700
空间
Space.

188
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,000
现实
Reality.

189
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,500
力量
Power.

190
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,170
灵魂
Soul.

191
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,340
心灵
Mind.

192
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,630
还有时间
And Time.

193
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,520
再跟我说一遍他的名字
Tell me his name again.

194
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,650
灭霸
Thanos.

195
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,120
他就像瘟疫  托尼
He's a plague, Tony.

196
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,290
他入侵星球  肆意夺取
He invades planets. He takes what he wants.

197
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,630
抹去半数人口
He wipes out half the population.

198
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,070
当初是他派洛基来的
He sent Loki.

199
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,700
纽约的袭击  是他搞的鬼
The attack on New York, that's him.

200
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,580
决战来了
This is it.

201
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:19,840
我们还有多少时间
What's our timeline?

202
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,310
不知道  他拿到了力量和空间宝石
No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones.

203
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,100
这已经使他成为全宇宙最有威力的人了
That already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe.

204
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,230
如果他拿到全部六颗宝石  托尼
If he gets his hands on all six stones, Tony...

205
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,940
他能以此前无法想象的方式毁灭生命
He could destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

206
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,900
你刚刚真的说了"此前无法想象"吗
Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?

207
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,190
你真的要倚在宇宙大锅上吗
Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

208
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,220
是叫这个吗
Is that what it is?

209
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,180
我就不跟你计较了
I'm going to allow that.

210
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,450
如果灭霸需要全部六颗
If Thanos needs all six,

211
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,410
那我们何不毁了这颗
why don't we just stick this one down a garbage disposal?

212
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,460
不行
No can do.

213
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,670
我们曾起誓要以性命维护时间宝石
We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives.

214
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,940
我还曾起誓要戒掉乳制品
And I swore off dairy...

215
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,300
但班杰瑞以我命名了一种冰淇淋口味
but then Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me.

216
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,090
-斯塔克狂热榛仁  -不赖啊
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts. - Not bad.

217
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,300
有点牙碜
A bit chalky.

218
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,380
我最喜欢大块绿巨人热巧克力
A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge is our favorite.

219
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,300
-有这玩意吗  -不重要
- That's a thing? - Whatever.

220
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,890
重点是  情况会变
Point is, things change.

221
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,720
我们保护时间宝石的誓言不能改变
Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change.

222
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,680
这颗宝石可能是我们对抗灭霸的最佳机会了
And this stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

223
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,600
那么反过来
Yeah, so conversely,

224
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,980
也可能是他对付我们的最佳机会
it may also be his best chance against us.

225
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,560
如果我们不能尽职的话
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

226
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,440
你的职责究竟是什么
What is your job exactly?

227
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,340
除了捏气球动物
Besides making balloon animals.

228
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,990
保护你的现实  混球
Protecting your reality, douchebag.

229
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,780
好了  各位  我们能先别吵吗
Okay, guys. Could we table this discussion right now?

230
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,740
事实就是  我们有这颗宝石
The fact is we have this stone.

231
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,480
我们知道它在哪
We know where it is.

232
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,910
幻视还带着心灵宝石不知道人在何处呢
Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone...

233
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,150
我们得马上找到他
and we have to find him now.

234
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,170
问题就在这里
Yeah, that's the thing.

235
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,080
什么意思
What do you mean?

236
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,700
两周前  幻视关闭了他的应答机
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder.

237
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,630
他下线了
He's offline.

238
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,700
-什么  -嗯
- What? - Yeah.

239
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,050
托尼  你又弄丢一个超级机器人
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

240
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,550
我没弄丢他  他没那么简单了  他在进化
I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

241
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,040
那谁能找到幻视
Who could find Vision then?

242
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,080
该死
Shit.

243
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,770
史蒂夫·罗杰斯或许能
Probably Steve Rogers.

244
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,960
太好了
Oh, great.

245
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,170
或许吧
Maybe.

246
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:53,960
但是
But...

247
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,590
打给他
Call him.

248
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,550
没那么简单
It's not that easy.

249
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,990
天呐  我们真是好久没联络了  是吧
God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

250
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,770
是啊
No.

251
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,890
复仇者联盟解散了  我们完了
The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

252
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,440
解散了
Broke up?

253
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,460
像乐队那样吗  像披头士那样吗
Like a band? Like... Like the Beatles?

254
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,190
队长和我闹得很僵
Cap and I fell out hard.

255
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,990
我们现在不说话了
We're not on speaking terms.

256
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,240
托尼  听我说
Tony, listen to me.

257
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,740
托尔死了
Thor's gone.

258
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,550
灭霸要来了
Thanos is coming.

259
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,870
你跟不跟谁说话都无所谓了
It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.

260
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,970
翻盖手机
Flip phone.

261
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,210
博士  你是在自己动头发吗
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would ya?

262
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,540
现在没有
Not at the moment, no.

263
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,200
你没事吧
You okay?

264
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,950
-帮帮他  -班纳
- Help him! - Banner!

265
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,710
-王  精神点  -去吧  我们能行
- Wong! Look alive! - Go, go! We got it!

266
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,930
星期五  什么情况
Friday, what am I looking at?

267
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,710
不确定  我还在查看
Not sure. I'm working on it.

268
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,520
你最好把时间宝石
You might wanna put that Time Stone

269
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,050
塞后兜里  博士
in your back pocket, Doc!

270
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,460
还是用它更好
Might wanna use it.

271
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,430
内德  我需要你分散大家的注意
Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

272
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,790
我去
Holy shit.

273
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,450
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die!

274
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,930
那里有架飞船
There's a spaceship!

275
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,620
-怎么回事啊  -天呐
- What's going on? - Oh, my God!

276
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,110
你们这些孩子怎么回事
What's the matter with you kids?

277
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,390
没见过宇宙飞船啊
You never seen a spaceship before?

278
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,000
星期五  疏散43街以南的群众
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd Street.

279
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,080

283
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,940
灭霸的孩子手下
at the hands of the Children of Thanos.

284
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,730
心怀感激吧
Be thankful...

285
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,250
你们毫无意义的人生将贡献...

286
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,030
抱歉  地球今天歇业
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

287
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,970
你们最好收拾东西滚蛋
You better pack it up and get outta here.

288
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,160
宝石守护者
Stonekeeper.

289
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,390
这喋喋不休的动物能替你说话吗
Does this chattering animal speak for you?

290
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,210
当然不  我想说什么自己说
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

291
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,340
你们在这座城市和这颗星球都不受欢迎
You're trespassing in this city and on this planet.

292
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,770
就是滚蛋的意思  章鱼哥
He means get lost, Squidward.

293
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,090
他让我厌烦
He exhausts me.

294
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,010
把宝石拿来给我
Bring me the stone.

295
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,800
班纳  你想出手吗
Banner, you want a piece?

296
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,360
并不想
No, not really.

297
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,990
但我什么时候如愿过了
But when do I ever get what I want?

298
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,810
这就对了
That's right.

299
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,160
好  加把劲
Okay. Push!

300
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,020
好久没见了
It's been a while.

301
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,230
能再见到你会很高兴的  哥们
It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.

302
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,060

Okay.

303
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,360
容我...我得集中精神
Let me just... I need to concentrate here for a second.

来啊  拜托
Come on, come on, man.

305
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,530
天呐
God!

306
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:28,990
那家伙呢
Where's your guy?

307
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,420
我不知道  我们最近有点问题
I don't know. We've sorta been having a thing.

308
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,550
-现在不是有问题的时候  -我知道
- It's no time for a thing. - I know.

309
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,910
那才是问题  来吧
That's the thing right there. Let's go.

310
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,560
哥们  你让我在巫师面前下不来台了
Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

311
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,810
托尼  抱歉  不是我不能  就是他不想
Tony, I'm sorry. Either I can't or he won't.

312
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,550
没事的
It's okay.

313
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,230
退后吧  替我看着点他  谢谢
Hey, stand down. Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

314
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,890
-交给我吧  -该死
- I have him. - Damn it.

315
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,750
那是哪来的
Where'd that come from?

316
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,600
是纳米科技
It's nanotech.

317
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,540
喜欢吗  是我...
You like it? A little something I...

318
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,970
班纳博士  如果你的绿朋友不打算来了
Doctor Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us...

319
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,160
快把宝石送走
Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

320
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,540
我人在宝石在
It stays with me.

321
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,770
没错  再见
Exactly. Bye.

322
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,530
托尼  你没事吧

323
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,760
-情况怎么样  是好是坏  -可好了
- How we doing? Good? Bad? - Really, really good.

324
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,180
可好了  你想不想帮忙啊
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

325
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,490
我也想  他不肯出来
I'm trying. He won't come out.

326
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,790
锤子
Hammer.

327
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,070
拜托  绿巨人  你这是干什么啊
Come on, Hulk! What are you doing to me?

328
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,570
出来啊  出来啊
Come out! Come out! Come out!

329
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,470
不要
No!

330
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,270
什么叫"不要"
What do you mean, "No"?

331
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,920
好啊  斯塔克先生  你好吗
Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

332
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,040
孩子  你哪冒出来的

学校组织去现代艺术博物馆
A field trip to MoMA.

334

这家伙什么毛病  斯塔克先生
What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

335
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,090
他是外太空来的
Uh, he's from space.

336
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,450
他是来偷一个巫师的项链的
He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.

337
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,870
你的能力很有意思
Your powers are quaint.

338
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,900
你一定很受孩子的喜欢吧
You must be popular with children.

339
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,500
虽然是简单的咒语  但不可攻破
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

340
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,780
那我就先杀了你再拿
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

341
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,580
你会发现
You'll find

342
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,530
想解除
removing

343
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,360
一个死人的咒语
a dead man's spell

344
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,070
会很困难
troublesome.

345
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,050
你会生不如死
You'll only wish you were dead.

346
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,230
不
No!

347
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,330
孩子  就是那个巫师  快去
Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

348
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,030
去了
On it!

349
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,620
好过分
Not cool.

350
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,330
抓到你了
Gotcha!

351
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,460
等等
Wait!

352
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,010
斯塔克先生  我被光吸上去了
Uh, Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

353
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,310
撑着  孩子
Hang on, kid.

354
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,950
王  我婚礼你一定要来
Wong, you're invited to my wedding.

355
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,250
给我点动力  星期五
Give me a little juice, Friday.

356
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,640
启动17A
Unlock 17:A.

357
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,960
彼得  放手吧  我来接住你
Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

358
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,660
但你叫我救巫师的
But you said save the wizard!

359
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,870
我不能呼吸了
I can't breathe.

360
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,620
我们太高了  你要没空气了
We're too high up. You're running out of air.

361
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,750
是啊  这讲得通
Yeah. That makes sense.

362
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,970
斯塔克先生  这里面闻起来像新车
Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

363
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
一路顺风  孩子
Happy trails, kid.

364
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,730
-星期五  送他回家  -好
- Friday, send him home. - Yep.

365
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,650
拜托
Oh, come on!

366
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,170
老板  波茨小姐来电
Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

367
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,380
托尼  天呐
Tony? Oh, my God.

368
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,800
你没事吧  怎么回事啊
Are you all right? What's going on?

369
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,380
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

370
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,850
但我们8:30的预约可能得延期了
I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.

371
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,580
为什么
Why?

372
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,920
就是我可能一时半会儿回不去
Just 'cause I'll probably not make it back for a while.

373
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,250
告诉我你没在那艘飞船上
Tell me you're not on that ship.

374
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,100
嗯
Yeah.

375
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,590
天呐  不  告诉我你没在那艘飞船上
God, no, please tell me you're not on the ship.

376
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,130
亲爱的  对不起
Honey, I'm sorry.

377
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,230
对不起  我不知道该怎么说
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

378
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,070
给我回来  托尼  我发誓
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God.

379
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,090
-派珀  -赶紧给我回来
- Pep. - Come back here right now.

380
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,610
回来
Come back.

381
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,220
老板  信号要断了
Boss, we're losing her.

382
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,390
我也去
I'm going too.

383
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,690
天呐
Oh, my God!

384
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,240
我就该待在校车上
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

385
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,590
你去哪
Where you going?

386
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,840
时间宝石被夺走了
The Time Stone's been taken.

387
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,800
圣殿无人守护
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

388
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,470
你要怎么办
What will you do?

389
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,180
我要打个电话
I'm gonna make a call.

390
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,700
{\an9}BGM: Rubberband Man  By  The Spinners

391
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,720
唱吧  德拉克斯
Sing it, Drax!

392
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,000
我们为什么要这么做来着
Why are we doing this again?

393
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,710
有人发了求救信号  火箭
It's a distress signal, Rocket.

394
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,800
可能有人有危险
Someone could be dying.

395
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,300
这我懂  但我们为什么要来
I get that, but why are we doing it?

396
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,370
因为我们是好人
'Cause we're nice.

397
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,100
或许求救的人
And maybe whoever it is

398
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,890
会给我们点切达奶酪作为感谢
will give us a little cheddar cheese for our effort.

399
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,380
-这不是重点  -这不是重点
- Which isn't the point. - Which isn't the point.

400
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,600
如果他不给谢礼
I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

401
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,520
我们就夺他的船
We take his ship.

402
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,650
-没错  -正确
- Exactly! - Bingo!

403
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,510
好嘞
All right!

404
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,140
我们要到了
We are arriving.

405
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,400
好了  护卫队
All right, Guardians,

406
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,070
别忘了  情况可能很危险
don't forget this might be dangerous...

407
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,220
大家都凶起来
so let's put on our mean faces.

408
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,040
格鲁特  马上把那玩意放起来
Groot, put that thing away, now.

409
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,230
别让我再说你
I don't wanna tell you again.

410
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,400
格鲁特
Groot.

411
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,070
我是格鲁特
I am Groot!

412
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,240
怎么说话呢
Language!

413
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,130
你胆子不小  小子
You got some acorns on you, kid.

414
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,630
自从你开始分泌树液
Ever since you got a little sap,

415
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,370
你就变成了个小混蛋
you're a total d-hole.

416
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,120
再这么下去  我就把那玩意给砸了
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces.

417
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,340
发生了什么
What happened?

418
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,800
天呐
Oh, my God.

419
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,640
看来我们别想拿钱了
Looks like we're not getting paid.

420
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,580
开雨刷  开雨刷
Wipers! Wipers!

421
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,360
把它弄掉
Get it off.

422
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,990
这哥们怎么会还活着
How the hell is this dude still alive?

423
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,990
他不是个"哥们"
He is not a dude.

424
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,660
你是个哥们
You're a dude.

425
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,910
这  是个男人
This... This is a man.

426
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,630
一个帅气的肌肉男
A handsome, muscular man.

427
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,430
我也挺肌肉的
I'm muscular.

428
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,690
你骗谁呢  奎尔
But who are you kidding, Quill?

429
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,480
你再吃一个三明治就是一身肥膘了
You're one sandwich away from fat.

430
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,310
得了吧
Yeah, right.

431
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,150
没错  奎尔  你是胖了点
It's true, Quill. You have put on weight.

432
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:50,880
什么
What?

433
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,720
卡魔拉  你也觉得我...
Gamora, do you think I'm...

434
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,850
他很焦虑  愤怒
He is anxious, angry.

435
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,400
他失去了很多  非常愧疚
He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

436
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,940
简直就像一个海盗跟一个天使生了个孩子
It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

437
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,920
这对我真是一记警钟啊  好吧
This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.

438
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,760
我去买个博飞健身器  认真减肥
I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit.

439
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,050
再去弄个哑铃
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

440
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,510
你知道哑铃是不能吃的吧
You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

441
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,930
他的肌肉就像是柯塔蒂金属纤维做的
It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.

442
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,910
别给他的肌肉按摩了
Stop massaging his muscles.

443
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,540
弄醒他
Wake him up.

444
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,420
醒来
Wake.

445
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,900
你们是谁
Who the hell are you guys?

446
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,530
自从我认识灭霸  他就只有一个目标
The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal.

447
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,420
让宇宙获得平衡
To bring balance to the universe

448
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,530
方法是抹去一半生命
by wiping out half of all life.

449
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,750
他以前会一个个星球地杀人
He used to kill people planet by planet,

450
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,710
一次次地进行屠杀
massacre by massacre.

451
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
包括我的星球
Including my own.

452
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,930
如果他拿到全部六颗无限宝石
If he gets all six Infinity Stones...

453
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,590
那他打一个响指就能实现愿望
he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.

454
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,460
你似乎对灭霸很了解
You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

455
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,090
卡魔拉是灭霸的女儿
Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

456
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,180
你父亲杀了我弟弟
Your father killed my brother.

457
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,230
天呐
Oh, boy.

458
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,450
严格讲是继父
Stepfather, technically.

459
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,150
她跟你一样恨他
And she hates him as much as you do.

460
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,360
家家有本难念的经
Families can be tough.

461
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,000
我父亲死前
Before my father died,

462
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,130
才跟我说我还有个异母姐姐
he told me that I had a half-sister...

463
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,700
被他囚禁在了地狱
that he imprisoned in Hel.

464
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,590
然后她回了家  捅瞎了我的眼睛
And then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye.

465
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,140
于是我不得不杀了她
So I had to kill her.

466
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,870
人生啊  是吧
That's life though, isn't it, I guess.

467
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,830
兜兜转转
Goes round and round and...

468
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,310
我能理解你的痛苦
I feel your pain.

469
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,940
我也能理解你的痛苦
I feel your pain as well, because...

470
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,900
虽然这不是比赛
I mean, it's not a competition,

471
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,610
但我也吃过不少苦
but I've been through a lot.

472
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,270
我爸杀了我妈
My father killed my mother.

473
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,180
然后我不得不杀了我爸
And then I had to kill my father.

474
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,430
那可痛苦了
That was hard.

475
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,890
可能比杀姐姐还痛苦
Probably even harder than having to kill a sister.

476
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,830
而且我还两眼完好无损地回来了
Plus, I came out with both my eyes, which was...

477
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,730
我需要一把锤子  不是勺子
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

478
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,020
这玩意怎么开  有什么...
How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of, uh...

479
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,740
四位密码  是生日吗
A four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.

480
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,780
-你干什么呢  -开走你们的飞行舱
- What are you doing? - Taking your pod.

481
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,490
你别想
No, you're not.

482
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,210
你今天别想开走我们的飞行舱  先生
You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

483
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,540
奎尔  你是在故意把嗓音压低吗
Quill, are you making your voice deeper?

484
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,550
-没有  -就有
- No. - You are.

485
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,820
你在模仿那个男神  好奇怪
You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

486
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,840
我没有
No, I'm not.

487
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,890
-他又来了  -我的嗓音就是这样
- He just did it again! - This is my voice.

488
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,560
你在嘲笑我吗
Are you mocking me?

489
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,610
-你在嘲笑我吗  -别闹了  你又那样了
- Are you mocking me? - Stop it. You did it again.

490
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,790
他想模仿我
He's trying to copy me.

491
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,630
你给我停下
I need you to stop doing that.

492
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,290
-够了  -他先开始的
- Enough! - He's doing it first.

493
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,960
我们得阻止灭霸
We need to stop Thanos.

494
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,590
所以  我们得查明
Which means we need to find out

495
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,510
他接下来要去哪
where he's going next.

496
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,490
虚无知地[不去哪]
Knowhere.

497
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,840
他肯定会去什么地方的
He must be going somewhere.

498
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,620
不对  虚无知地吗
No, no. Knowhere?

499
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,250
那是个地方  我们去过  烂爆了
It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

500
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,170
-抱歉  那是我们的食物  -现在不是了
- Excuse me, that's our food. - Not anymore.

501
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,800
托尔  他为什么要去虚无知地
Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

502
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,310
因为多年来
Because for years...

503
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,650
现实宝石一直安全地放在那里
the Reality Stone's been safely stored there

504
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,230
在一个叫收藏者的人手上
with a man called the Collector.

505
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,240
如果是在收藏者手上  那就不安全了
If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe.

506
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,780
只有白痴才会把宝石交给那人
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

507
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,360
-或是天才  -你怎么知道
- Or a genius. - How do you know...

508
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,560
他不会去找其他的宝石
he's not going for one of the other stones?

509
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,060
一共有六颗宝石
There are six stones out there.

510
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,080
灭霸已经拿到了力量宝石
Thanos already has the Power Stone...

511
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,650
那是他上周摧毁山达尔星时偷走的
because he stole it last week when he decimated Xandar.

512
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,820
他从我这儿偷走了空间宝石
He stole the Space Stone from me...

513
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,740
还摧毁了我的飞船  杀了我一半人民
when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people.

514
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,920
时间和心灵宝石在地球上很安全
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.

515
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
在复仇者联盟手里
They're with the Avengers.

516
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,300
-复仇者联盟  -地球最强大的英雄
- The Avengers? - Earth's mightiest heroes.

517
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,390
就像凯文·贝肯吗
Like Kevin Bacon?

518
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,800
或许有他吧  我不知道
He may be on the team. I don't know.

519
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,180
我挺久没回去了
I haven't been there in a while.

520
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,640
至于灵魂宝石  根本没人见过
As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that.

521
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,090
都没人知道它在哪
No one even knows where it is.

522
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,020
因此灭霸得不到它
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

523
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,730
因此他会去虚无知地
Therefore he's going to Knowhere.

524
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,050
好拿到现实宝石
Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.

525
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,180
不客气
You're welcome.

526
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,900
那我们得马上去虚无知地
Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

527
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,060
不  我们得去尼德威阿尔
Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

528
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,990
-那个词是编出来的  -所有词都是编出来的
- That's a made-up word. - All words are made up.

529
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,100
尼德威阿尔是真的  你认真的吗
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

530
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,500
那地方是个传奇
That place is a legend.

531
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,650
他们能造出最强大  最可怕的武器
They make the most powerful, horrific weapons

532
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,460
来折腾整个宇宙
to ever torment the universe.

533
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,750
我可是非常愿意去的
I would very much like to go there, please.

534
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,710
这只兔子说的对
The rabbit is correct

535
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,420
它显然是你们当中最聪明的
and clearly the smartest among you.

536
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,330
-兔子  -只有矮人伊特里能造出我需要的武器
- Rabbit?  - Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me the weapon I need.

537
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,260
你就是船长吧  先生
I assume you're the captain, sir.

538
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,340
有眼光
You're very perceptive.

539
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,680
你看起来像个高贵的领袖
You seem like a noble leader.

540
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,430
你愿意跟我一起去尼德威阿尔吗
Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

541
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,430
让我问下船长  等一下  我就是船长
Let me just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me!

542
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,090
-好  我加入  -太棒了
- Yeah. I'll go. - Wonderful!

543
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,940
不过  我才是船长
Except for that I'm the captain.

544
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,480
安静
Quiet.

545
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,360
-那是我的背包  -坐下吧你
- That's my backpack. - Go sit down.

546
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,150
这是我的飞船
Look, this is my ship.

547
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,510
我才不会去什么...
And I'm not goin' to...

548
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,240
等一下  那是什么样的武器
Wait, what kinda weapon are we talkin' about here?

549
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,930
能杀灭霸的那种
The Thanos-killing kind.

550
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,990
你不觉得我们每个人都应该弄把那样的武器吗
Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

551
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,160
不  你们没有驾驭它们的力量
No. You simply lack the strength to wield them.

552
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,120
你们的身体会碎裂
Your bodies would crumble

553
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,790
思维会崩溃  甚至疯掉
as your minds collapsed into madness.

554
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,540
我现在更想要了  会不会很奇怪
Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

555
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,620
没错  是有一点
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

556
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,210
如果我们不去虚无知地
If we don't go to Knowhere

557
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,090
而灭霸又得到一颗宝石
and Thanos retrieves another stone...

558
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,630
他就会强大得不可阻挡了
he'll be too powerful to stop.

559
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,300
-他已经不可阻挡了  -我有办法了
- He already is. - I got it figured out.

560
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,840
我们有两艘船
We got two ships

561
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,800
和一群各种各样的白痴
and a large assortment of morons.

562
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,430
我和格鲁特跟这位海盗天使走
So me and Groot will go with the pirate angel here.

563
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,060
白痴们去虚无知地
And the morons will go to Knowhere

564
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,920
试图阻止灭霸
to try to stop Thanos.

565
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,190
-好吗  好  -很好
- Cool? Cool. - So cool.

566
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,130
就说一句
For the record...

567
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,310
我知道你跟他走
I know that you're going with him

568
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,770
是因为灭霸不在那里
because it's where Thanos isn't.

569
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,190
你真的不应该
You know, you really shouldn't

570
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,970
这样跟你的船长讲话  奎尔
talk that way to your captain, Quill.

571
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,850
走了  格鲁特
Come on, Groot.

572
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,930
把游戏放下  你的脑子会烂掉的
Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

573
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,400
再会了  祝你们好运  白痴们
I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

574
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,610
再见
Bye.

575
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,670
小幻
Vis?

576
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,880
又是宝石
Is it the stone again?

577
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,090
它好像在跟我说话
It's as if it's speaking to me.

578
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,840
它说什么
What does it say?

579
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,970
我...不知道  但它说了些什么
I don't... I don't know, but something.

580
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,400
告诉我你感觉到了什么
Tell me what you feel.

581
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,580
我只感觉到了你
I just feel you.

582
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,230
10点有一班去格拉斯哥的列车
So there's a 10:00 A.M. to Glasgow...

583
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,440
这样你回去之前  我们还能一起多待会儿
which would give us more time together before you went back.

584
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,840
如果我错过那班车呢
What if I miss that train?

585
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,270
11点还有一班
There's an 11:00.

586
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,260
如果我错过所有车次呢
What if I missed all the trains?

587
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,030
这次我不回去了怎么样
What if this time I didn't go back?

588
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,450
但你向斯塔克承诺过
But you gave Stark your word.

589
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,870
我更想向你许下承诺
I'd rather give it to you.

590
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,950
也有人在等我回去
Well, there are people who are expecting me too, you know.

591
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,410
我们都做过承诺
We both made promises.

592
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,480
但没对彼此承诺过
Not to each other.

593
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,730
旺达
Wanda.

594
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,080
两年了  我们偷来了这些相处的时光
For two years, we've stolen these moments...

595
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,650
想看看我们是不是合得来
trying to see if this could work and...

596
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,200
我不知道
I don't know.

597
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,840
我只想说说自己的看法
You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself.

598
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,180
我觉得...
I think...

599
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,260
-我们合得来  -是啊
- It works. - It works.

600
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,160
是啊
It works.

601
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,960
留下来
Stay.

602
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,420
留下陪我
Stay with me.

603
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,470
或者算了  如果我出格了
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

604
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,480
他们是什么
What are they?

605
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,350
正是宝石警告我的东西
What the stone was warning me about.

606
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,410
我得走了
I have to go.

607
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,030
不  幻视
No, Vision.

608
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,740
幻视  如果那是真的
Vision, if that's true,

609
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,790
那也许回去不是最好的选择
then maybe going isn't the best idea.

610
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,620
旺达  我...
Wanda, I...

611
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,080
幻视
Vision!

612
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,870
那刀刃  让我无法变相
The blade, it stopped me from phasing.

613
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,200
-那可能吗  -不该这样的
- Is that even possible? - It isn't supposed to be.

614
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,410
我的系统正在崩溃
My systems are failing.

615
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,420
我开始觉得我们不该下床了
I'm beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.

616
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,130
小幻
Vis!

617
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,390
放弃宝石  她才能活
Give up the stone, and she lives.

618
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,100
放开他
Hands off.

619
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,360
快  快
Come on. Come on.

620
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,160
快  你得站起来
Come on, you gotta get up.

621
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,740
你得站起来  快
You gotta get up. Come on.

622
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,160
我们得走了
We have to go.

623
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,420
拜托  你走吧
Please. Please leave.

624
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,080
你让我留下来的
You asked me to stay.

625
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,210
-我要留下  -拜托
- I'm staying. - Please.

626
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,080
-起来  -我起不来
- Get up. - I can't.

627
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,500
我们不想杀你  但我们不会手软的
We don't wanna kill you, but we will.

628
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,000
过时不候
You'll never get the chance again.

629
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,060
你能站起来吗
Can you stand?

630
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,940
谢谢你  队长
Thank you, Captain.

631
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,730
先扶你上飞机吧
Let's get you on the jet.

632
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:05,120
我们不是说好了吗
Now, I thought we had a deal.

633
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,720
别走太远  保持联系  不要冒险
Stay close, check in, don't take any chances.

634
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,620
对不起
I'm sorry.

635
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,670
我们只是需要时间
We just wanted time.

636
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,750
去哪里  队长
Where to, Cap?

637
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,630
回家
Home.

638
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,220
我们会安全的  会安全的
We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

639
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,680
泽霍贝瑞人
Zehobereians.

640
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,180
母亲  我母亲呢
Mother! Where's my mother?

641
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,100
不选一边就要死
Choose a side or die.

642
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,130
母亲
Mother!

643
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,090
一边是启示
One side is a revelation...

644
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,430
另一边是只有少数人拥有的荣耀
the other an honor known only to a few.

645
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,590
你怎么了  小家伙
What's wrong, little one?

646
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,600
我母亲  我母亲在哪
My mother. Where is my mother?

647
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,400
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

648
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,810
我叫卡魔拉
Gamora.

649
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,980
你很有斗志  卡魔拉
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

650
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,490
来
Come.

651
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,200
我来帮你
Let me help you.

652
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,670
你看
Look.

653
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,380
很漂亮是吧
Pretty, isn't it?

654
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,260
平衡感恰到好处  正是一切事物应有的样子
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

655
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,100
左右偏移太多的话...
Too much to one side or the other...

656
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,150
给  你试试
Here. You try.

657
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,570
安详地去见你们的造物主吧
Now, go in peace to meet your maker.

658
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,450
集中注意力
Concentrate.

659
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,670
这就对了  你掌握了
There. You've got it.

660
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,720
卡魔拉
Gamora.

661
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:31,990
你知不知道这些手榴弹
Do you know if these grenades

662
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,700
是炸掉蛋蛋的  还是毒气弹
are the blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?

663
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,380
因为我想
Because I was thinking about

664
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,560
在皮带上挂几个
hanging a couple on my belt right here.

665
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,450
但我可不想被炸...
But I don't want to if they're the...

666
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:39,900
我需要你帮忙
I need to ask a favor.

667
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:41,860
当然
Yeah, sure.

668
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:44,630
不管怎样
One way or another,

669
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,110
我们都会与灭霸交手的
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

670
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,910
这就是手榴弹的用处
Which is what the grenades are for.

671
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,040
抱歉  你要我帮什么忙
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

672
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,160
如果事情出了岔子
If things go wrong...

673
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,630
如果灭霸抓到了我
If Thanos gets me...

674
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,050
我要你答应我
I want you to promise me...

675
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,300
你会杀了我
you'll kill me.

676
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,010
什么
What?

677
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,680
我知道一些他不知道的事
I know something he doesn't.

678
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,770
如果他知道了
And if he finds it out,

679
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,580
那整个宇宙都有危险了
the entire universe could be at risk.

680
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,710
你知道什么
What do you know?

681
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:26,570
如果我告诉你  你也知道了
If I tell you, you'd know too.

682
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,610
如果这事如此重要
If it's so important...

683
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,820
难道我不该知道吗
shouldn't I?

684
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,130
除非你想死
Only if you wanna die.

685
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,370
为什么总有人要死
Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

686
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:38,200
你就
Just...

687
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,750
相信我  可能还要杀了我
Trust me. And possibly kill me.

688
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,270
我倒是愿意
I mean, I'd like to.

689
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,210
真的  但是你...
I really would. But you...

690
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,590
向我发誓
Swear to me.

691
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,890
以你母亲的名义向我发誓
Swear to me on your mother.

692
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,560
好
Okay.

693
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:10,320
好吧
Okay.

694
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,190
老兄
Dude.

695
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,760
你在那里站了多久
How long have you been standing there?

696
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,840
一小时
An hour.

697
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,220
一小时
An hour?

698
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,220
你不是吧
Are you serious?

699
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,260
我已经掌握了
I've mastered the ability

700
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,560
纹丝不动站立的能力
of standing so incredibly still...

701
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,890
肉眼是看不到我的
that I become invisible to the eye.

702
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:44,690
看好了
Watch.

703
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,320
你在吃花生糖呢
You're eating a zarg-nut.

704
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,950
但是我的动作
But my movement...

705
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,410
如此缓慢
was so slow...

706
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,970
令人难以察觉
that it's imperceptible.

707
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,620
不是
Mmm, no.

708
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,050
我坚信没人能看到我
I'm sure I'm invisible.

709
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,500
德拉克斯
Hi, Drax.

710
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,830
该死的
Damn it.

711
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,520
这地方似乎已经荒废了
This place looks deserted.

712
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:30,460
第三象限有动静
I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.

713
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,400
没错  我也看到了
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

714
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,450
我们在这里降落吧
Let's put down right here.

715
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,380
东西不在我这里
I don't have it.

716
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,480
银河系的人都知道
Everyone in the galaxy knows

717
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,320
你愿出卖亲兄弟
you'd sell your own brother...

718
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,940
来为你可悲的收藏
if you thought it would add even the slightest trinket

719
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,800
增添一点小装饰品
to your pathetic collection.

720
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,560
我知道现实宝石在你手上  蒂万
I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

721
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,730
把宝石交给我  你就不必遭受折磨
Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

722
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,200
我和你说了
I told you.

723
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,620
我卖掉了
I sold it.

724
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,180
我为什么要骗你
Why would I lie?

725
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,620
我想骗人是你的天性
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

726
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,220
那是自杀
Like suicide.

727
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,130
看来你明白啊
You do understand.

728
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,510
就算是你也不会交出如此宝贵的东西
Not even you would surrender something so precious.

729
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,540
我当时并不知道它是什么
I didn't know what it was.

730
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,110
那你比我想的还蠢
Then you're more of a fool than I took you for.

731
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,230
是他
It's him.

732
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,190
最后的机会  你这骗子
Last chance, charlatan.

733
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,200
宝石呢
Where's the stone?

734
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:46,730
今天
Today...

735
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,150
德拉克斯
Drax. Drax.

736
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,580
他要为我妻女的死付出代价
...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

737
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,830
德拉克斯  等等
Drax, wait.

738
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,410
别急  别急
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

739
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,390
德拉克斯
Drax.

740
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:01,970
德拉克斯  听我说
Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.

741
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,030
他还没拿到宝石
He doesn't have the stone yet.

742
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,800
如果我们拿到宝石  就能阻止他
If we get it, then we can stop him.

743
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,950
我们得先拿到宝石  没错
We have to get the stone first. Yeah.

744
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,050
不
No.

745
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,730
不  为了奥薇特  为了卡玛莉亚
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

746
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,420
睡吧
Sleep.

747
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,310
好吧
Okay.

748
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,860
卡魔拉  螳螂  你们去右边
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

749
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,460
另一个右边
The other right.

750
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,050
为什么
Why?

751
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,670
为什么是你  女儿
Why you, daughter?

752
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,010
好快啊
That was quick.

753
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,600
了不起  了不起  了不起
Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

754
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,810
你难过了吗  女儿
Is that sadness I sense in you, daughter?

755
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,270
我心里知道  你依然在乎我
In my heart, I knew you still cared.

756
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,980
但毕竟没法确定
But one never knows for sure.

757
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,630
现实往往令人失望
Reality is often disappointing.

758
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,040
至少以前是的
That is, it was.

759
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,210
现在
Now...

760
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,660
现实可以任我摆布了
reality can be whatever I want.

761
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,410
你早知道我会来
You knew I'd come.

762
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,240
我就指望着呢
I counted on it.

763
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,500
我们需要谈谈  小家伙
There's something we need to discuss, little one.

764
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,410
灭霸
Thanos!

765
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,170
不
No!

766
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,190
放了她  奶昔大哥
Let her go, Grimace.

767
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,540
彼得
Peter.

768
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,400
我叫你走右边的
I told you to go right.

769
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,170
现在还说这个
Now? Really?

770
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,560
你放了她
You let her go!

771
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,090
你是那个男友
Ah, the boyfriend.

772
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:13,890
不
No.

773
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,500
我更喜欢自视为
Like to think of myself more as a

774
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,240
杀泰坦的长期炮友
Titan-killing, long-term booty call.

775
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,320
-放了她  -彼得
- Let her go. - Peter.

776
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:25,140
否则我轰掉你阴囊一样的下巴
I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face.

777
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,510
不是他
Not him.

778
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,920
你答应过我  你答应了
You promised. You promised.

779
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,690
女儿
Oh, daughter.

780
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,090
你对他提的要求他做不到
You expect too much from him.

781
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,090
她跟你提过了  是吧
She's asked, hasn't she?

782
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:59,490
动手吧
Do it.

783
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,040
动手
Do it!

784
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,870
我叫你走右边的
I told you to go right.

785
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,950
我爱你超过一切
I love you more than anything.

786
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,050
我也爱你
I love you too.

787
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,860
我喜欢他
I like him.

788
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,980
幻视还没消息吗
Still no word from Vision?

789
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:15,980
卫星在爱丁堡附近跟丢了他
Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

790
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,620
驾驶盗走的昆式战斗机
On a stolen Quinjet

791
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,960
还有四个全球头号通缉犯
with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

792
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,180
你知道他们是"罪犯"
You know they're only criminals

793
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,250
只是因为你非要那么称呼他们
because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

794
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,170
天呐  罗德
My God, Rhodes.

795
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,660
你鬼扯的本事能跟我有一拼了
Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

796
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,040
要不是因为《协议》
If it weren't for those Accords,

797
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,960
幻视根本不会走
Vision would've been right here.

798
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,590
我记得你也签了那份文件  中校
I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

799
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,930
是啊
That's right.

800
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:39,880
我也为此付出了代价
And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

801
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,550
你后悔了吗
You have second thoughts?

802
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:42,740
现在没了
Not anymore.

803
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,190
国务卿先生
Mr. Secretary.

804
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,830
你好大胆
You got some nerve.

805
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,530
这我承认
I'll give you that.

806
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,010
你现在正需要点胆呢
You could use some of that right now.

807
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,760
世界有危险了
The world's on fire.

808
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,210
你觉得一切都被原谅了吗
And you think all is forgiven?

809
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,190
我想要的不是原谅
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

810
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,360
我更不想征求同意了
And I'm way past asking permission.

811
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,380
地球刚失去了最好的守卫者
Earth just lost her best defender.

812
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,270
我们是来战斗的
So we're here to fight.

813
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,470
如果你想挡路
And if you wanna stand in our way...

814
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:23,990
我们连你一起打
we'll fight you too.

815
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
逮捕他们
Arrest them.

816
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,170
这就去
All over it.

817
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,190
得上军事法庭了
That's a court-martial.

818
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,030
见到你真高兴  队长
It's great to see you, Cap.

819
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:43,830
你也是  罗德
You too, Rhodey.

820
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,350
你们
You guys...

821
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,480
看上去状况真差
really look like crap.

822
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,870
这几年很辛苦吧
Must've been a rough couple years.

823
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:56,850
是啊  没怎么住五星酒店
Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

824
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,190
我觉得你们看上去很棒
I think you look great.

825
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,670
是啊  我回来了
Yeah, I'm back.

826
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,030
你好啊  布鲁斯
Hi, Bruce.

827
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:17,410
小娜
Nat.

828
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,380
好尴尬
This is awkward.

829
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:26,940
那他们还会再回来吧
So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

830
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,190
他们显然能找到我们
And they can clearly find us.

831
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:30,330
我们得全体出动  克林特呢
We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

832
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,900
《协议》的事后
After the whole Accords situation,

833
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,650
他和斯科特做了协议
he and Scott took a deal.

834
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,540
他们的家人承受不了  所以他们被软禁在家了
It was too tough on their families. They're on house arrest.

835
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,850
-斯科特是谁  -蚁人
- Who's Scott? - Ant-Man.

836
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,770
有蚁人还有蜘蛛侠
There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?

837
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,380
好吧
Okay, look.

838
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,500
灭霸有全宇宙最大的军队
Thanos has the biggest army in the universe...

839
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,110
他不会罢休的  除非他得到
and he is not gonna stop until he gets...

840
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:49,980
幻视的宝石
Vision's stone.

841
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,350
那我们得保护它
Then we have to protect it.

842
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,180
不  我们得毁掉它
No, we have to destroy it.

843
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:56,690
我好好想过了
I've been giving a good deal of thought

844
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:57,890
我脑袋上的这东西
to this entity in my head.

845
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,690
关于它的性质
About its nature.

846
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,150
以及它的组成
But also its composition.

847
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:03,950
我觉得如果它遭遇
I think if it were exposed

848
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,460
足够强大的能量源
to a sufficiently powerful energy source...

849
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,250
特性类似其本身的能量  那或许
something very similar to its own signature, perhaps...

850
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,050
它的分子完整性就会被破坏
its molecular integrity could fail.

851
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,450
你也会随之被摧毁
Yeah, and you with it.

852
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:18,750
这不是个选择
We're not having this conversation.

853
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,700
只有销毁宝石
Eliminating the stone is the only way

854
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,890
才能确保灭霸拿不到它
to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

855
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,580
那代价太高了
That's too high a price.

856
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,850
只有你有能力付出这代价
Only you have the power to pay it.

857
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:38,870
灭霸威胁宇宙一半的生命
Thanos threatens half the universe.

858
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:41,380
不能让一人的生命阻碍战胜他的希望
One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

859
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:42,760
这样不对
But it should.

860
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,500
我们不以命换命  幻视
We don't trade lives, Vision.

861
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,340
队长  70年前  你付出生命
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life...

862
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,920
来挽救了多少人
to save how many millions of people?

863
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,020
告诉我  这有什么不同
Tell me, why is this any different?

864
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,870
因为  你可能还有选择
Because you might have a choice.

865
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,240
你的心灵是由
Your mind is made up

866
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,940
许多东西叠加而成的
of a complex construct of overlays.

867
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,630
贾维斯  奥创  托尼  我  宝石
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

868
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,470
他们混在了一起
All of them mixed together,

869
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,360
彼此学习
all of them learning from one another.

870
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,300
你是说幻视并不只是那块宝石
You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

871
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,240
我是说  如果我们取出宝石
I'm saying that if we take out the stone...

872
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,200
还剩下不少的幻视
there's still a whole lot of Vision left.

873
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,790
或许还是最好的部分
Perhaps the best parts.

874
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:17,960
这能做到吗
Can we do that?

875
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,190
我在这里是不行
Not me, not here.

876
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,480
那你最好赶紧找到
Well, you better find someone

877
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,950
合适的地方和人
and somewhere fast.

878
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,080
罗斯可不会让你们
Ross isn't just gonna let you guys

879
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,690
再回老房间住
have your old rooms back.

880
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,650
我知道个地方
I know somewhere.

881
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:46,770
御林护卫
The Kingsguard

882
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,860
和女子皇家护卫队都已得到通知
and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

883
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,090
边境部落呢
And the Border Tribe?

884
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,880
还剩的都通知了
Those that are left.

885
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,550
派人传话去贾巴里
Send word to the Jabari as well.

886
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,930
姆巴库就喜欢好好打一场
M'Baku likes a good fight.

887
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,270
他呢
And what of this one?

888
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,620
他可能已经厌倦了战争
This one may be tired of war.

889
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,860
但白狼已经休息够久了
But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

890
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,730
哪里要打仗了
Where's the fight?

891
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,260
他们就来
On its way.

892
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,560
我为灭霸效力这么久
In all the time I've served Thanos...

893
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,010
从未让他失望过
I have never failed him.

894
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:06,270
如果我赶到了我们泰坦星的汇合点
If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan...

895
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,280
而时间宝石还连在
with the Time Stone still attached

896
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,400
你这讨厌鬼身上
to your vaguely irritating person...

897
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,190
我会受到  责罚的
there would be judgment.

898
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:22,950
给我
Give me...

899
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:28,700
宝石
the stone.

900
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,420
你还真是件忠心耿耿的外套啊
You're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

901
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,410
说到忠诚
Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

902
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,280
什么...
What the...

903
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,970
-我知道你要说什么  -你不该在这儿的
- I know what you're gonna say. - You should not be here.

904
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,110
-我本想回家的  -我不想听
- I was gonna go home. - I don't wanna hear it.

905
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,150
但下去的路好远啊
But it was such a long way down

906
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:51,950
我路上就在想你
and I just thought about you on the way...

907
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:52,660
你还说上了
And now I gotta hear it.

908
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:53,910
然后我就卡在飞船边上了
...and kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

909
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:56,540
这件战衣的直觉特别准
And this suit is ridiculously intuitive,

910
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,040
-真的  -该死
- by the way. - God damn it.

911
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,750
所以如果要说  我在这儿其实怪你
So, if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

912
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:01,830
-你说什么  -我收回
- What did you just say? - I take that back.

913
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:03,210
现在  我在外太空里了
And now, I'm here in space.

914
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,650
是啊  在我不想要你在的地方
Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

915
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,190
这里不是科尼岛  不是学校出游
This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip.

916
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,470
这可是有去无回
This is a one-way ticket.

917
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,400
听到了吗  别假装你都想清楚了
You hear me? Don't pretend you thought this through.

918
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,190
-不  我想清楚了  -你肯定没有
- No, I did think this through. - I know you didn't.

919
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,870
你根本不可能想清楚了
You could not have possibly thought this through.

920
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,610
我想当个友好邻居蜘蛛侠
You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man...

921
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,010
但没有邻居了还怎么做
if there's no neighborhood.

922
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,360
好吧  这话不是很通
Okay, that didn't really make sense,

923
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:21,730
但你明白我想说什么
but you know what I'm trying to say.

924
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,270
好了  还有情况要处理呢
Come on. We got a situation.

925
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,920
看到下面那个了吗  他有麻烦了
See him down there? He's in trouble.

926
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,850
你有什么计划
What's your plan?

927
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:30,840
说吧
Go.

928
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,980
好吧
Okay, okay...

929
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,490
好吧  你看过一部特老的电影《异形》吗
Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?

930
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,420
疼吧  是不是
Painful, aren't they?

931
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,140
原本是用来做显微手术的
They were originally designed for microsurgery.

932
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:48,560
任何一个
And any one of them...

933
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,710
都能瞬间杀死你的朋友
could end your friend's life in an instant.

934
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,650
我得告诉你  他算不上是我的朋友
I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend.

935
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:01,610
救他命更多是职业上的礼貌
Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.

936
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,570
你什么都没救
You've saved nothing.

937
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:09,090
你的力量跟我比微不足道
Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.

938
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:11,690
是啊  但那孩子看的电影多
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

939
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:28,100
棒啊  等等  这是什么
Yes! Wait. What are those?

940
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:44,920
我们还没正式介绍过呢
Hey, we haven't officially met.

941
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:46,980
好吧
Cool.

942
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,790
我们得调头回去
We gotta turn this ship around.

943
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,880
是啊  他现在想跑了
Yeah, now he wants to run.

944
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,810
-好计划  -我想保护宝石
- Great plan. - No, I want to protect the stone.

945
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,800
我还想要你谢我呢
And I want you to thank me.

946
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,510
说吧  我听着呢
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

947
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:00,590
谢什么  差点把我轰进太空里吗
For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

948
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:02,920
刚是谁救了你个魔法师  是我
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

949
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,510
真不知道你这么膨胀的脑袋怎么塞得进头盔里
I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.

950
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,800
承认吧  你早该听我的躲起来
Admit it, you should've ducked out when I told you to.

951
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,580
我让你别插手的  你不肯
I tried to bench you. You refused.

952
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:11,570
不像你人生中的其他所有人  我不为你工作
Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

953
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:13,130
因为这个
And due to that fact,

954
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,710
我们现在在一艘飞行甜甜圈上
we're now in a flying doughnut...

955
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,610
离地球十万八千里  还没有后援
billions of miles from Earth with no backup.

956
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,610
-我是后援  -不  你是偷渡的
- I'm backup. - No, you're a stowaway.

957
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:19,750
大人说话呢
The adults are talking.

958
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,560
抱歉  我搞不懂你们什么关系
I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here.

959
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,390
他是你的养子吗
What is he, your ward?

960
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,380
不是
No.

961
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,860
-我是彼得  -斯特兰奇博士[奇异博士]
- I'm Peter, by the way. - Doctor Strange.

962
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,420
你在用诨号吗
You're using our made-up names.

963
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,930
那我是蜘蛛侠
I'm Spider-Man, then.

964
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,570
这艘船在自我纠正航线
This ship is self-correcting its course.

965
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:35,570
它在自动驾驶
Thing's on autopilot.

966
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:36,700
我们能控制它吗
Can we control it?

967
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,380
飞回家
Fly us home?

968
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:43,290
-斯塔克  -嗯
- Stark? - Yeah.

969
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:44,620
你能带我们回家吗
Can you get us home?

970
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:45,890
我听到了
Yeah, I heard you.

971
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,390
我在想  或许我们不该回去
I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

972
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:51,980
我们决不能
Under no circumstances

973
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:54,530
把时间宝石送去灭霸那里
can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

974
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,230
你恐怕还不明白
I don't think you quite understand

975
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:57,510
-事情的严重性吧  -什么  不
- what's at stake here. - What? No.

976
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,790
是你不明白
It's you who doesn't understand...

977
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:02,650
灭霸萦绕我的脑海六年了
that Thanos has been inside my head for six years.

978
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:04,180
自从他派了支军队去纽约
Since he sent an army to New York

979
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,350
现在他又回来了
and now he's back.

980
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,420
我不知道该怎么办
And I don't know what to do.

981
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,310
所以我不能确定
So I'm not so sure

982
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,260
是该在我们的地盘还是他的地盘跟他打
if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his...

983
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:14,510
但你看到了他们做的事  看到了他们能做什么
but you saw what they did, what they can do.

984
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,220
至少去他的地盘  还能出其不意
At least on his turf, he's not expecting it.

985
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,730
我说  我们打上门去
So I say we take the fight to him.

986
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:21,360
博士
Doctor.

987
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,170
你同意吗
Do you concur?

988
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:29,990
好吧  斯塔克  我们去找他
All right, Stark. We go to him.

989
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,440
但你要明白
But you have to understand...

990
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,800
如果我要选择救你
if it comes to saving you

991
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,250
那孩子  或是时间宝石
or the kid or the Time Stone...

992
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,430
我会毫不犹豫地任你们死去
I will not hesitate to let either of you die.

993
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:45,010
我必须如此  因为这事关宇宙的命运
I can't, because the universe depends on it.

994
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,430
好  好三观
Nice. Good, moral compass.

995
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:50,360
我们没问题了
We're straight.

996
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:52,820
好吧  小子
All right, kid.

997
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:56,290
你是复仇者了
You're an Avenger now.

998
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,350
我觉得你可能饿了
I thought you might be hungry.

999
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,040
我一直讨厌那椅子
I always hated that chair.

1000
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,540
我听说了
So I've been told.

1001
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:55,280
即便如此  我还是希望有天你能坐上去
Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

1002
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,720
我讨厌这个房间
I hated this room.

1003
01:05:58,550 --> 01:05:59,640
这艘飞船
This ship.

1004
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,640
我讨厌我曾经的生活
I hated my life.

1005
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:07,780
这你也跟我说过
You told me that too.

1006
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,830
每天都说
Every day.

1007
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,930
说了将近20年
For almost 20 years.

1008
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,640
你带走我时  我还是孩子
I was a child when you took me.

1009
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:24,980
我救了你
I saved you.

1010
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,260
不
No.

1011
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,510
不  我们在母星上时  本来很幸福
No. We were happy on my home planet.

1012
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:36,090
饿着肚子睡觉
Going to bed hungry...

1013
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:38,430
到处找残羹冷炙
scrounging for scraps.

1014
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,180
你的星球当时已濒临崩溃
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.

1015
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:43,040
是我阻止了那发生
I'm the one who stopped that.

1016
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,720
你知道它后来怎么样了吗
Do you know what's happened since then?

1017
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,410
新生的孩子
The children born...

1018
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,790
都能吃饱肚子  看到清澈的天空
have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies.

1019
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:53,530
那里成了天堂
It's a paradise.

1020
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,580
因为你杀了半个星球的人
Because you murdered half the planet.

1021
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,620
为得到拯救  这只是小小代价
A small price to pay for salvation.

1022
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:01,760
你疯了
You're insane.

1023
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,960
小家伙  这只是简单的数学
Little one, it's a simple calculus.

1024
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,250
宇宙是有限的  资源也是有限的
This universe is finite, its resources finite.

1025
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:11,320
如果生命不加以控制  就会消亡
If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist.

1026
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,640
它需要纠正
It needs correction.

1027
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,780
这你怎么知道
You don't know that!

1028
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,430
只有我知道这个道理
I'm the only one who knows that.

1029
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:22,770
至少  只有我愿意为此采取行动
At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.

1030
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:25,630
曾经
For a time...

1031
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:32,430
你也有那样的意愿
you had that same will...

1032
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,380
与我一同战斗
as you fought by my side.

1033
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:38,020
女儿
Daughter.

1034
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,520
我不是你的女儿
I'm not your daughter.

1035
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,930
我恨自己的一切都是你教的
Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

1036
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:48,200
而你因此
And, in doing so,

1037
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,750
也成了银河系里最威猛的女人
made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

1038
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:56,280
所以我派你去寻找灵魂宝石
That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

1039
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,970
抱歉我让你失望了
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1040
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,230
我是失望
I am disappointed.

1041
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,350
但不是因为你没找到
But not because you didn't find it.

1042
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,150
是因为你找到了
But because you did.

1043
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:16,920
但你却撒谎了
And you lied.

1044
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:35,620
星云
Nebula.

1045
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,770
别这样
Don't do this.

1046
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,320
一段时间之前
Some time ago,

1047
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,350
你妹妹溜上船来杀我
your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

1048
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,650
求你别这样
Please don't do this.

1049
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,790
还差点成功了
And very nearly succeeded.

1050
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:54,050
所以我把她带来了这里
So I brought her here.

1051
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,770
好跟她谈谈
To talk.

1052
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,730
住手  住手
Stop. Stop it.

1053
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,060
我以生命起誓
I swear to you on my life.

1054
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,670
我没找到灵魂宝石
I never found the Soul Stone.

1055
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:23,690
读取记忆文件
Accessing memory files.

1056
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,150
你知道他要做什么
You know what he's about to do.

1057
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,920
他总算准备好了  他要去找宝石
He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones.

1058
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,290
-所有宝石  -他不可能得到所有宝石
- All of them. - He can never get them all.

1059
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,140
他会的
He will!

1060
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:32,040
他不能  星云
He can't, Nebula.

1061
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:34,730
因为我找到了灵魂宝石的地图
Because I found the map to the Soul Stone...

1062
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,800
然后把它烧成了灰  我把它烧了
and I burned it to ash. I burned it.

1063
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:44,520
你很强壮
You're strong.

1064
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,660
这是我教的
Me.

1065
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,690
你很慷慨
You're generous.

1066
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,190
这是我教的
Me.

1067
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:58,330
但我可没教过你撒谎
But I never taught you to lie.

1068
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,060
所以你很不擅长
That's why you're so bad at it.

1069
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:08,190
灵魂宝石在哪
Where is the Soul Stone?

1070
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:26,750
沃密尔星球
Vormir!

1071
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:46,240
宝石在沃密尔
The stone is on Vormir.

1072
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,750
带我去
Show me.

1073
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:55,160
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1074
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,330
在杯子里尿
Tinkle in the cup.

1075
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:57,860
我们不看  有什么可看的
We're not looking. What's there to see?

1076
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,190
小树枝是什么  谁都见过小树枝
What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig before.

1077
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:01,070
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1078
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,370
树人  把杯子里的东西
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1079
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:04,500
倒进太空里  然后再用杯子
out into space and go in the cup again.

1080
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:05,630
你会格鲁特语
You speak Groot?

1081
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,810
阿斯加德教这个  选修课
Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

1082
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,990
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1083
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,900
等我们快到了你会知道的
You'll know when we're close.

1084
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:12,540
尼德威阿尔的锻炉汲取
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1085
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:15,010
一颗中子星的炙热能量
the blazing power of a neutron star.

1086
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,760
我的锤子就是在那里铸造的
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

1087
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:21,890
可赞了
It's truly awesome.

1088
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:31,320
好吧  该拿出船长的样子了
Okay, time to be the captain.

1089
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,120
弟弟死了啊
So, dead brother, huh?

1090
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:40,230
嗯  那是挺烦人的
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1091
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,560
他以前也死过
Well, he's been dead before.

1092
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,010
但这次可能是真的了
But, no, this time I think it really might be true.

1093
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:49,890
你说你还有姐姐和爸爸
And you said your sister and your dad?

1094
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:50,890
都死了
Both dead.

1095
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:53,510
还有妈妈吧
But still got a mom, though?

1096
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,470
被黑暗精灵杀了
Killed by a dark elf.

1097
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,630
最好朋友呢
A best friend?

1098
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:58,060
利刃穿心而死
Stabbed through the heart.

1099
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,300
你真想执行这趟杀人任务吗
You sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

1100
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:07,840
非常想
Absolutely.

1101
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:12,130
愤怒  复仇  怒火  失去  后悔
Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...

1102
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,440
都是很好的动力
they're all tremendous motivators.

1103
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,930
让人脑袋很清醒
They really clear the mind.

1104
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,550
我没问题的
So I'm good to go.

1105
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,910
是啊  但这个灭霸
Yeah, but this Thanos we're talkin' about...

1106
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:22,120
他可是最厉害的
he's the toughest there is.

1107
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,340
-他是没打过我  -他打过的
- Well, he's never fought me. - Yeah, he has.

1108
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,860
他没打过我两次
He's never fought me twice.

1109
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:28,690
别忘了  我还要去铸把新锤子
And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

1110
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:30,510
这锤子最好厉害
It better be some hammer.

1111
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:37,300
我1500岁了
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1112
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:40,270
我杀过的敌人是我岁数的一倍
I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

1113
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:42,240
他们每个人都想杀死我
And every one of them would've rather killed me,

1114
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,730
但没人成功过
but none succeeded.

1115
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,720
我还活着是因为命运希望我活着
I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

1116
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:50,040
灭霸只是又一个这样的混蛋
Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards...

1117
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:51,830
而他会是又一个我复仇的对象
and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance.

1118
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,720
这是命运的意愿
Fate wills it so.

1119
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,750
如果你错了呢
And what if you're wrong?

1120
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:01,910
如果我错了
If I'm wrong, then...

1121
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,950
那我还有什么可失去的呢
what more could I lose?

1122
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,060
我可以失去很多
I could lose a lot.

1123
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:22,010
我个人而言可以失去很多呢
Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

1124
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,180
好吧
Okay.

1125
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,490
如果命运真希望你杀了那混球
If fate does want you to kill that crapsack...

1126
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,520
你会需要不止一颗眼球
you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.

1127
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,400
-这是什么  -你说呢
- What's this? - What's it look like?

1128
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:39,530
康特西亚星球上一个混蛋打赌输给我的
Some jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.

1129
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,720
他把眼睛给你了
He gave you his eye?

1130
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,090
不  他给了我100信用点
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1131
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,900
我那晚稍后溜进了他房里偷走了他的眼睛
I snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye.

1132
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,640
谢谢  好兔子
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1133
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,980
你该洗洗的
I would've washed that.

1134
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:02,070
我唯一能把它从康特西亚偷出来的办法就是塞进我
The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...

1135
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,670
我们到了
Hey, we're here!

1136
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,410
这玩意好像不好使
I don't think this thing works.

1137
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:10,790
怎么暗乎乎的
Everything seems dark.

1138
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,470
不是眼睛的问题
It ain't the eye.

1139
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:29,310
情况不对
Something's wrong.

1140
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,840
中子星熄灭了
The star's gone out.

1141
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,540
环也冻住了
And the rings are frozen.

1142
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,460
希望这些矮人
I hope these dwarves

1143
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,810
铸造的本事比打扫强
are better at forging than they are cleaning.

1144
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,850
或许他们是意识到
Maybe they realized that

1145
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:07,270
自己住在太空里的一个垃圾堆里
they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.

1146
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,010
这个锻炉几世纪都没熄过火了
This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

1147
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:15,380
你说灭霸有个手套  是吧
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

1148
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,650
对  怎么
Yes, why?

1149
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,480
像那样的吗
It look anything like that?

1150
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,790
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1151
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,160
回飞行舱去
Go back to the pod.

1152
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:31,020
伊特里  等等
Eitri, wait!

1153
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,380
住手
Stop!

1154
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,380
住手
Stop.

1155
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,370
托尔
Thor?

1156
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:40,870
这里发生了什么
What happened here?

1157
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:43,850
你本该保护我们的
You were supposed to protect us.

1158
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,360
阿斯加德本该保护我们的
Asgard was supposed to protect us.

1159
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,750
阿斯加德被毁了
Asgard is destroyed.

1160
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:55,350
伊特里  手套  你做了什么
Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

1161
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:11,200
环上住了300个矮人
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1162
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,810
我以为如果我听从他的命令  他们就会安全
I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe.

1163
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:19,900
我造出了他要的东西
I made what he wanted.

1164
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:25,770
一件能汲取宝石力量的装置
A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones.

1165
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,330
然后他还是杀了所有人
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1166
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,500
除了我
All except me.

1167
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,940
"你的命属于你"  他说
"Your life is yours," He said.

1168
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:45,050
"但你的手  属于我"
"But your hands are mine alone."

1169
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:48,040
伊特里  你的手不是重点
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1170
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,680
你设计的每一件武器
Every weapon you've ever designed,

1171
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,240
每把斧子  锤子  剑
every axe, hammer, sword...

1172
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,410
都在你脑袋里
it's all inside your head.

1173
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:57,340
我知道你现在觉得希望尽失
Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.

1174
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,510
相信我  我知道
Trust me, I know.

1175
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:04,100
但你我联手  我们能杀了灭霸
But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

1176
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:46,880
螳螂  听好了
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1177
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,090
我需要你去泰坦星见我
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1178
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:56,760
怎么了
Hey, what's going on?

1179
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:58,660
我们好像到了
I think we're here.

1180
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,930
这玩意恐怕没有自动停车功能
I don't think this rig has a self-park function.

1181
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,560
把手伸到方向装置里
Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.

1182
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,730
把这个合上
Close those around it.

1183
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:07,850
-懂吗  -好的
- You understand? - Yep, got it.

1184
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,230
这是给一个大块头准备的
This was meant for one big guy,

1185
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:11,710
-我们动作得同步  -好的  好了
- so we gotta move at the same time. - Okay, okay. Ready.

1186
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,120
我们最好转向
We might wanna turn.

1187
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:18,790
转向  转向啊
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1188
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:48,920
你没事吧
You all right?

1189
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:52,380
好悬啊
That was close.

1190
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,870
我欠你的
I owe you one.

1191
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,530
我想说  如果外星人
Let me just say, if aliens

1192
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:59,910
在我胸腔里植入了卵什么的
wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...

1193
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:00,930
而我吃掉了你们谁  那我很抱歉
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1194
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:03,590
余下的时间里不许你
I do not want another single pop culture reference

1195
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:04,950
再提流行文化梗了  懂吗
out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

1196
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:06,830
我是想说  有东西过来了
I'm trying to say that something is coming.

1197
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:15,500
灭霸
Thanos!

1198
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,900
拜托别把你的卵放进我身体里
Please don't put your eggs in me!

1199
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:41,300
别动  小丑
Stay down, clown.

1200
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,610
死吧  死亡毯子
Die, blanket of death!

1201
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:58,430
都别动  都给我冷静
Everybody stay where you are. Chill the eff out.

1202
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:01,110
我就问你一次
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1203
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,160
卡魔拉呢
Where is Gamora?

1204
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,980
我问你个更好的  卡魔拉是谁
Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

1205
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:09,050
我问你个更好的  为什么卡魔拉
I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

1206
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:10,980
告诉我她在哪  否则我发誓
Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you

1207
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,330
我会把这小怪物烧焦的
I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

1208
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:15,470
来吧  你打我的人  我打你的人  来吧
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1209
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,650
动手吧  奎尔  我承受得住
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1210
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:19,720
不  他承受不住
No, he can't take it!

1211
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:20,650
她说得对  你承受不住
She's right. You can't.

1212
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:23,010
是吗  你不告诉我她在哪吗  好啊
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine.

1213
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:24,200
我杀了你们三个
I'll kill all three of you

1214
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,370
然后揍到灭霸开口
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1215
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:27,280
从你开始
Starting with you.

1216
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,390
等等  灭霸
Wait, what, Thanos?

1217
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,730
好吧  我问你个问题
All right, let me ask you this one time.

1218
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:33,060
你效忠哪位主人
What master do you serve?

1219
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,130
我效忠哪位主人
What master do I serve?

1220
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,060
怎么  我该说"耶稣"吗
What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

1221
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:37,830
你是地球人
You're from Earth.

1222
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:38,770
我不是地球人  我是密苏里人
I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.

1223
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:40,280
那就是地球  白痴
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1224
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,230
你打我们干什么
What are you hassling us for?

1225
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,140
你们不是灭霸的人
So you're not with Thanos?

1226
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:45,660
灭霸的人
With Thanos?

1227
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,860
不  我是来杀灭霸的
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1228
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,930
他带走了我女人  等等  你们是谁
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

1229
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:53,250
我们是复仇者  哥们
We're the Avengers, man.

1230
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:55,850
你们是托尔说的人
You're the ones Thor told us about.

1231
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:57,050
你们认识托尔
You know Thor?

1232
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,000
是啊
Yeah.

1233
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:01,220
高个  长得不咋样  还需要别人救
Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.

1234
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:02,260
他现在在哪
Where is he now?

1235
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,680
这就是你的计划  用砖头拍他
This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1236
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,960
这是模具
It's a mold.

1237
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:23,260
国王的武器
A king's weapon.

1238
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:25,970
本该是阿斯加德最强大的
Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1239
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:29,750
理论上  它甚至能召唤彩虹桥
In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

1240
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:30,940
它有名字吗
Did it have a name?

1241
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:33,760
风暴斧
Stormbreaker.

1242
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,450
有点过了
That's a bit much.

1243
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,530
要怎么打造它
So how do we make it?

1244
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:42,210
你得重启锻炉
You'll have to restart the forge.

1245
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:45,710
唤醒濒死恒星的核心
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1246
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:50,780
兔子  启动飞行舱
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1247
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,390
这星球遭遇了什么
The hell happened to this planet?

1248
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:58,410
偏离自转轴八度
It's eight degrees off its axis.

1249
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,950
引力到处都是
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1250
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:04,820
我们有一个优势  他会自己来
Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us.

1251
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:06,840
我们要利用这一点
We'll use it.

1252
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:08,650
好了  我有个计划
All right, I have a plan.

1253
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,040
至少有个大致轮廓
Or at least the beginnings of one.

1254
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,350
非常简单  我们引他过来
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,

1255
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:12,790
把他打趴下  拿到需要的东西
pin him down, get what we need.

1256
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:14,200
我可不想跟他纠缠[陪他跳舞]
Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.

1257
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,900
我们只想拿手套
We just want the gauntlet.

1258
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,550
你打哈欠
Are you yawning?

1259
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,640
我讲解计划的时候你竟然打哈欠
In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down?

1260
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,270
你听见我说的了吗
Did you hear what I said?

1261
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:25,110
你说"我们需要计划"之后我就没在听了
I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

1262
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:26,620
好吧  他沉浸在自己的世界里
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1263
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:29,080
他们一般不会"不随机应变"
See, "Not winging it" isn't really what they do.

1264
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,170
那他们都会什么
Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

1265
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,860
打仇恨  拉群架
Kick names, take ass.

1266
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:33,960
没错
Yeah, that's right.

1267
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:42,480
好了  请各位都过来
All right, just get over here, please.

1268
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:44,670
爵先生  能不能让你的伙伴们围过来
Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

1269
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:46,760
别爵先生  叫我星爵就好
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1270
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,850
我们得联合起来
We gotta coalesce.

1271
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,810
因为如果我们只凭一腔勇气去面对他
'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...

1272
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:55,320
哥们  别说什么一腔勇气
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1273
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,810
我们不知道那是什么意思
We don't know what it means.

1274
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,560
我们很乐观  我喜欢你的计划
All right, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan.

1275
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,220
只不过它烂透了  让我来做计划
Except it sucks, so let me do the plan...

1276
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:04,230
这样就完美无缺了
and that way it might be really good.

1277
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:06,370
告诉他你斗舞拯救宇宙的事
Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

1278
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:08,490
-什么斗舞  -不值一提
- What dance-off? - It's nothing.

1279
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:09,750
就像那部电影《浑身是劲》一样
Like in Footloose, the movie?

1280
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,180
就是《浑身是劲》那样
Exactly like Footloose.

1281
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,620
它依然是史上最棒的电影吗
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1282
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:14,680
从来都不是
It never was.

1283
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:15,950
别打岔  好不好
Don't encourage this, all right?

1284
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,100
-好  -这位飞侠哥顿
- Okay. - We're getting no help

1285
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,800
-帮不上我们什么  -《飞侠哥顿》
- from Flash Gordon here. - Flash Gordon?

1286
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,780
那可是在夸我哦
By the way, that's a compliment.

1287
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,360
别忘了  我有一半人类血统
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1288
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,310
也就是说我有一半的蠢
So that 50% of me that's stupid...

1289
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:26,320
而你是百分百的蠢
that's 100% you.

1290
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,840
我真佩服你数学这么好
Your math is blowing my mind.

1291
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:28,880
打扰一下
Excuse me.

1292
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:33,510
你的朋友经常那样吗
But does your friend often do that?

1293
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:36,860
斯特兰奇  没事吧
Strange, we all right?

1294
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:48,450
你恢复了  你没事
You're back. You're all right.

1295
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:50,590
你刚刚怎么了
Hey, what was that?

1296
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:54,820
我推进了时间  浏览未来的可能性
I went forward in time to view alternate futures.

1297
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:58,160
看即将到来的一战所有可能出现的结果
To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.

1298
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,810
你看到了多少种
How many did you see?

1299
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,570
一千四百万六百零五种
14,000,605.

1300
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:06,050
我们赢了几种
How many did we win?

1301
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:11,930
一种
One.

1302
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:36,320
灵魂宝石最好在山上
The stone had better be up there.

1303
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,750
不然你妹妹就完了
For your sister's sake.

1304
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:06,790
欢迎  灭霸  阿拉尔斯之子
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1305
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,250
卡魔拉  灭霸之女
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1306
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,410
你认识我们
You know us?

1307
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:17,760
我被诅咒认识所有来到此地的人
It is my curse to know all who journey here.

1308
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,370
灵魂宝石在哪
Where is the Soul Stone?

1309
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,290
你应该知道
You should know...

1310
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:26,180
得到它的代价极大
it extracts a terrible price.

1311
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:29,250
我准备好了
I am prepared.

1312
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:34,090
我们一开始都这么以为
We all think that at first.

1313
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,750
但我们都错了
We are all wrong.

1314
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,860
你怎么如此熟悉这里
How is it you know this place so well?

1315
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:59,460
上一世我也想找无限宝石
A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.

1316
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,420
甚至曾把一个攥在手里过
I even held one in my hand.

1317
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:06,690
但它把我流放到这里
But it cast me out, banished me here.

1318
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:11,160
指引别人寻找我无法拥有的珍宝
Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.

1319
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,870
你所寻找的就在你面前
What you seek lies in front of you.

1320
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:25,390
你所害怕的也在那里
As does what you fear.

1321
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:27,720
这是什么
What's this?

1322
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:29,380
代价
The price.

1323
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:34,840
无限宝石中  灵魂宝石很特别
Soul holds a special place among the Infinity Stones.

1324
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:39,990
可以说它有一定的智慧
You might say it has a certain wisdom.

1325
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,320
告诉我它需要什么
Tell me what it needs.

1326
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,900
为了确保拥有它的人
To ensure that whoever possesses it...

1327
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:48,990
理解它的力量
understands its power...

1328
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:54,210
灵魂宝石需要献祭
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1329
01:26:54,730 --> 01:26:55,500
献祭什么
Of what?

1330
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:58,390
要得到灵魂宝石
In order to take the stone,

1331
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,890
你必须失去自己的珍爱之物
you must lose that which you love.

1332
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:04,700
以一个灵魂
A soul...

1333
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:06,970
换取一个灵魂
for a soul.

1334
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,710
我这一生  都梦想有一天
All my life, I dreamed of a day...

1335
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,590
有一瞬
a moment...

1336
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:30,880
让你得到应有的报应
when you got what you deserved.

1337
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:35,150
而我总是会失望
And I was always so disappointed.

1338
01:27:39,010 --> 01:27:39,950
但现在
But now...

1339
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,700
你杀戮  折磨
You kill and torture...

1340
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,170
还说这是仁慈
and you call it mercy.

1341
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,430
宇宙已对你作出了评判
The universe has judged you.

1342
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:03,700
你想得到奖赏  而它拒绝了你
You asked it for a prize, and it told you no.

1343
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:06,540
你失败了
You failed.

1344
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,790
知道为什么吗
And do you wanna know why?

1345
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:12,790
因为你没有爱过
Because you love nothing.

1346
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,600
你谁也不爱
No one.

1347
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:21,970
不
No.

1348
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:27,400
不是吧
Really?

1349
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:29,750
还流泪
Tears?

1350
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:32,070
他不是为自己流泪
They're not for him.

1351
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:47,520
不
No.

1352
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:50,810
这不是爱
This isn't love.

1353
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,680
我曾忽视过自己的命运
I ignored my destiny once.

1354
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,600
我不能再重蹈覆辙
I cannot do that again.

1355
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:02,440
就算是为你也不行
Even for you.

1356
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,130
对不起了  小家伙
I'm sorry, little one.

1357
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,250
不
No!

1358
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:14,420
高度降至2600  030方向
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1359
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,370
希望你是对的
I hope you're right about this.

1360
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:19,010
否则我们降落的速度会比你希望的快得多
Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.

1361
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:36,950
你说我们要让瓦坎达
When you said we were going to open Wakanda

1362
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:38,000
对世界开放
to the rest of the world...

1363
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:40,050
我没想到是这样
this is not what I imagined.

1364
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:41,910
那你以为是什么样
And what did you imagine?

1365
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,380
奥运会
The Olympics.

1366
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,030
或许开家星巴克
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1367
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:00,720
我们要鞠躬吗
Should we bow?

1368
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,310
要  他是国王
Yeah, he's a king.

1369
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:05,120
我好像总要为什么谢你
Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.

1370
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:07,840
你在干嘛呢
What are you doing?

1371
01:32:08,150 --> 01:32:10,510
我们这儿没这习俗
Uh, we don't do that here.

1372
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:12,810
我们会遭到多猛烈的袭击
So how big of an assault should we expect?

1373
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:15,960
先生  我认为你应该准备应对非常猛烈的袭击
Sir, I think you should expect quite a big assault.

1374
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:16,880
情况如何
How we looking?

1375
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,580
我的御林护卫会参战
You will have my Kingsguard,

1376
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:22,310
还有边境部落  女子皇家护卫队  还有...
the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

1377
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,290
一个还算稳定的百岁老人
And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

1378
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,070
你怎么样了  巴基
How you been, Buck?

1379
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,750
还行吧  毕竟都快世界末日了
Not bad, for the end of the world.

1380
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:48,620
多态结构的
The structure is polymorphic.

1381
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:52,400
对  神经元是非序列排列的
Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

1382
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,360
为什么不直接
Why didn't you just

1383
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,470
重新编码突触  让它们协调工作
reprogram the synapses to work collectively?

1384
01:32:57,670 --> 01:33:00,670
因为我们没想到
Because we didn't think of it.

1385
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:02,620
你相信你尽力了
I'm sure you did your best.

1386
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:03,640
你能做到吗
Can you do it?

1387
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:08,010
可以  但这里有超过两万亿神经元
Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here.

1388
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:11,400
一点小误差就可能导致大规模的回路故障
One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.

1389
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:13,170
会需要点时间  哥哥
It will take time, brother.

1390
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:15,430
多长时间
How long?

1391
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:16,960
越长越好
As long as you can give me.

1392
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:23,270
有东西进入了大气层
Something's entered the atmosphere.

1393
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:42,550
队长  我们有麻烦了
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

1394
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,370
天哪  我爱这个地方
God, I love this place.

1395
01:33:54,390 --> 01:33:55,890
别高兴太早  各位
Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.

1396
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:58,170
穹顶外有更多入侵者过来了
We got more incoming outside the dome.

1397
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,450
来不及了
It's too late.

1398
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:21,120
我们现在就得把宝石毁掉
We need to destroy the stone now.

1399
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,750
幻视  你给我躺回去
Vision, get your ass back on the table.

1400
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:24,240
我们会拖住它们
We will hold them off.

1401
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,630
旺达  这石头一旦从他头部取出
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out of his head...

1402
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:29,250
你就把它毁掉
you blow it to hell.

1403
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:30,270
我会的
I will.

1404
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:33,890
全城疏散  启动全面防御
Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.

1405
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:36,200
给这人拿块盾牌
And get this man a shield.

1406
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:48,490
我认为你没太搞懂状况
I don't think you get the scientifics here.

1407
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:51,320
这些环很巨大  你想移动它们
These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving...

1408
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:53,760
会需要大得多的东西才能把它们带动起来
you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.

1409
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:55,980
-交给我  -交给你
- Leave that to me. - Leave it to you?

1410
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:57,720
伙计  你在太空里
Buddy, you're in space.

1411
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:59,770
你就拿了一根绳和一个...
All you got is a rope and a...

1412
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,330
发动引擎
Fire the engines!

1413
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:28,950
再加把力  兔子
More power, rabbit!

1414
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,230
干得漂亮  小子
Well done, boy.

1415
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,830
那就是尼德威阿尔
That's Nidavellir.

1416
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:27,060
该死
Damn it.

1417
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,990
"该死"  "该死"是什么意思
"Damn it"? What's "Damn it"?

1418
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:30,530
机械装置坏了
The mechanism is crippled.

1419
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:32,140
-什么  -光圈不打开
- What? - With the iris closed,

1420
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:33,320
我就没法加热金属
I can't heat the metal.

1421
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,940
加热需要多久
How long will it take to heat it?

1422
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:37,120
几分钟  或许更久  怎么了
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1423
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,600
我去把它撑开
I'm gonna hold it open.

1424
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:41,900
那是自杀
That's suicide.

1425
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:44,490
不拿风暴斧就去找灭霸也是自杀
So is facing Thanos without that axe.

1426
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,170
情况如何  布鲁斯
How we looking, Bruce?

1427
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,280
我觉得我已经掌握诀窍了
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1428
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:02,370
感觉太棒了
This is amazing, man.

1429
01:37:02,370 --> 01:37:04,790
就像不用变身就成了绿巨人
It's like being the Hulk without actually...

1430
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,080
我没事  我没事
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1431
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:12,840
有两处热信号
I've got two heat signatures

1432
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,200
要冲破林线了
breaking through the tree line.

1433
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:44,580
谢谢你和我们并肩作战
Thank you for standing with us.

1434
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:08,130
你那个朋友呢
Where's your other friend?

1435
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,330
他的命你要用命偿
You will pay for his life with yours.

1436
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:14,240
灭霸会拿到那块宝石的
Thanos will have that stone.

1437
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:16,620
不可能
That's not gonna happen.

1438
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:18,790
你是在瓦坎达
You are in Wakanda now.

1439
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:23,050
灭霸除了灰烬和鲜血什么也别想得到
Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

1440
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:24,940
我们...
We

1441
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:27,990
不吝鲜血
have blood to spare.

1442
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,580
他们投降了吗
They surrender?

1443
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:42,850
并没有
Not exactly.

1444
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:11,210
什么鬼
What the hell?

1445
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:15,760
看来惹毛她了
Looks like we pissed her off.

1446
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:28,200
他们在自杀
They're killing themselves.

1447
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,110
看到他们的牙了吗
You see the teeth on those things?

1448
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:06,840
好了  你退后  山姆
All right, back up, Sam.

1449
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,470
别烧了你的翅膀
You're gonna get your wings singed.

1450
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:22,360
队长  如果他们绕过防线
Cap, if these things circle the perimeter

1451
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,280
从我们后面进来
and get in behind us...

1452
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,220
就没人挡在他们和幻视之间了
there's nothing between them and Vision.

1453
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:27,350
那我们最好确保他们都在我们眼前
Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

1454
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:28,540
怎么做
How do we do that?

1455
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,420
打开屏障
We open the barrier.

1456
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:39,260
听我口令  打开西北17区屏障
On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

1457
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,390
请求确认  陛下
Requesting confirmation, My King.

1458
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,200
你是说要打开屏障吗
You said open the barrier?

1459
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,610
听我口令
On my signal.

1460
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:46,650
这将是瓦坎达的末日
This will be the end of Wakanda.

1461
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:51,620
那也是史上最壮烈的末日
Then it will be the noblest ending in history.

1462
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:05,870
瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever!

1463
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,500
打开
Now!

1464
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:51,170
还需要多久  苏睿
How much longer, Shuri?

1465
01:41:51,170 --> 01:41:52,670
我都还没开始  哥哥
I've barely begun, brother.

1466
01:41:52,670 --> 01:41:54,520
你最好快点
You might want to pick up the pace.

1467
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:03,790
众神之父  赐我力量
Allfathers, give me strength.

1468
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:05,400
你清楚吗  小子
You understand, boy?

1469
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:08,660
你这是要承受一颗恒星的所有能量
You're about to take the full force of a star.

1470
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:10,930
你会没命的
It'll kill you.

1471
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:13,190
除非我死了
Only if I die.

1472
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:15,250
对
Yes.

1473
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,850
没命就是这个意思
That's what killing you means.

1474
01:42:46,490 --> 01:42:48,670
撑住  撑住  托尔
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1475
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:41,210
托尔  说话  拜托
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1476
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:43,120
托尔  你没事吧
Thor, you okay?

1477
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:50,030
我觉得他要死了
I think he's dying.

1478
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:51,810
他需要风暴斧
He needs the axe!

1479
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:55,020
斧柄呢
Where's the handle?

1480
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,520
树人  快帮我找斧柄
Tree, help me find the handle!

1481
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:10,500
太多了
There's too many of 'em!

1482
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:41,180
这下你们倒霉了
You guys are so screwed now!

1483
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,600
给我叫灭霸出来
Bring me Thanos!

1484
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:20,480
嗯
Oh, yeah.

1485
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,770
你是像个灭霸
You're much more of a Thanos.

1486
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:30,170
看来乌木喉已经死了
I take it the Maw is dead.

1487
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:34,700
今天损失惨重
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1488
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,830
不过  他也算完成了任务
Still, he accomplished his mission.

1489
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,840
对你恐怕不是好事
You may regret that.

1490
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:42,790
他带你来
He brought you face-to-face

1491
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,790
正面迎战魔法师了
with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1492
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,460
那你觉得他把你带来了哪里
And where do you think he brought you?

1493
01:46:51,290 --> 01:46:54,090
我猜猜  你家吗
Let me guess. Your home?

1494
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,490
曾经是
It was.

1495
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,020
而且它曾经美丽
And it was beautiful.

1496
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,660
泰坦曾经如同很多行星
Titan was like most planets.

1497
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:11,940
要吃饭的嘴多  能吃的却远远不够
Too many mouths, not enough to go around.

1498
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:15,160
当我们面临灭绝  我提出了解决方案
And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

1499
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:17,520
屠杀
Genocide.

1500
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:22,460
但是随机  公正  不分贫富
But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike.

1501
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:25,370
他们说我疯了
They called me a madman.

1502
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,780
我的预言最终成真了
And what I predicted came to pass.

1503
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,100
恭喜  你是预言家
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1504
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:35,410
我是幸存者
I'm a survivor.

1505
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,660
想谋杀数十亿生命的幸存者
Who wants to murder trillions.

1506
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,620
集齐六颗宝石  只要我一个响指
With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.

1507
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:46,930
他们就将灰飞烟灭  我认为这是慈悲
They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.

1508
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:49,980
然后呢
And then what?

1509
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:53,410
然后是久违的休息
I'd finally rest...

1510
01:47:54,210 --> 01:47:57,140
在全宇宙的感激中坐看日出
and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.

1511
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:01,760
最难的抉择需要最强的意志
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

1512
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:07,410
你会发现我们的意志不比你弱
I think you'll find our will equal to yours.

1513
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:09,710
我们
Our?

1514
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:17,440
小菜一碟  奎尔
Piece of cake, Quill.

1515
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:20,010
没错  如果你的目标是激怒他  你做到了
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

1516
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:01,830
别让他握拳
Don't let him close his fist.

1517
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:07,250
魔法
Magic.

1518
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:08,910
魔法再来
More magic.

1519
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:10,890
魔法踢
Magic with a kick.

1520
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:12,360
魔法...
Magic with a...

1521
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:15,080
小虫子
Insect!

1522
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:53,880
好啊
Well, well.

1523
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:54,990
你该杀了我的
You should've killed me.

1524
01:49:54,990 --> 01:49:57,170
那多浪费零件
It would've been a waste of parts!

1525
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:03,670
卡魔拉呢
Where's Gamora?

1526
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:46,040
晕了吗  别放手
Is he under? Don't let up.

1527
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,950
要快  他很强壮
Be quick. He is very strong.

1528
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,140
帕克  帮忙  过来
Parker, help! Get over here.

1529
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:52,870
她控制不住多久  开始
She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1530
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:00,070
得张开他的手指才能脱下来
We gotta open his fingers to get it off.

1531
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:00,840
我以为他不好抓呢
I thought you'd be hard to catch.

1532
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,370
说清楚  这是我的计划
For the record, this was my plan.

1533
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:05,280
现在不怎么威风了吧
You're not so strong now, huh?

1534
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:07,400
卡魔拉呢
Where is Gamora?

1535
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:09,830
我的卡魔拉
My Gamora.

1536
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:12,160
胡扯
No, bullshit!

1537
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:13,310
她在哪
Where is she?

1538
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:16,240
他很痛苦
He is in anguish.

1539
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:17,480
很好
Good.

1540
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:21,470
他在哀悼
He... He mourns.

1541
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:25,360
这个怪物能为什么哀悼
What does this monster have to mourn?

1542
01:51:26,370 --> 01:51:27,250
卡魔拉
Gamora.

1543
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:31,800
什么
What?

1544
01:51:32,310 --> 01:51:33,630
他带她去了沃密尔星球
He took her to Vormir.

1545
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:36,140
然后带了灵魂宝石回来
He came back with the Soul Stone.

1546
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,350
却没有她
But she didn't.

1547
01:51:40,590 --> 01:51:43,560
奎尔  你得冷静下来  明白吗
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?

1548
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:47,820
别跟他打  我们快拔下来了
Don't, don't. Don't engage. We almost got this off!

1549
01:51:49,690 --> 01:51:50,790
告诉我她在撒谎
Tell me she's lying.

1550
01:51:52,910 --> 01:51:55,860
混蛋  告诉我你没那么做
Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

1551
01:51:57,270 --> 01:52:00,680
我没办法
I had to.

1552
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:02,270
不  你没有
No, you didn't.

1553
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:04,090
你没有
No, you didn't.

1554
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,970
-你怎么能  -奎尔
- No, you didn't! - Quill!

1555
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:12,190
住手  住手
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

1556
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:13,430
住手
Hey, stop! Stop!

1557
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:15,480
下来了  下来了  我抓到了
It's coming, it's coming. I got it, I got it!

1558
01:52:18,650 --> 01:52:19,360
天呐
Oh, God.

1559
01:53:19,230 --> 01:53:21,860
来吃瘪啊  太空狗
Come and get some, space dogs!

1560
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,620
来啊  叫你们好看
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1561
01:53:27,630 --> 01:53:29,380
来啊  尝尝我的厉害
Come on! Get some!

1562
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:32,230
-枪怎么卖  -不卖
- How much for the gun? - Not for sale.

1563
01:53:32,530 --> 01:53:34,340
好吧  那你胳膊怎么卖
Okay. How much for the arm?

1564
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:37,960
那胳膊我要定了
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1565
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:47,930
新发型
New haircut?

1566
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:50,140
你学我留胡子了
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1567
01:53:52,370 --> 01:53:54,480
对了  这是我朋友  树人
By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.

1568
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:56,840
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1569
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:59,310
我是史蒂夫·罗杰斯
I am Steve Rogers.

1570
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:21,770
撤退  马上撤退
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1571
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:33,110
集中对左侧开火  山姆
Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

1572
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:34,630
我在开火呢
I'm doing it.

1573
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,140
她刚刚怎么不来
Why was she up there all this time?

1574
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:02,970
她下来了  去拿吧
She's on the field. Take it.

1575
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:37,870
各位  幻视那边有情况
Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

1576
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:41,610
谁去帮助幻视
Somebody get to Vision!

1577
01:55:42,450 --> 01:55:44,330
-我去  -我就去
- I got him! - On my way.

1578
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:52,360
他会孤独一人死去  你也是
He'll die alone. As will you.

1579
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:53,820
她不是一个人
She's not alone.

1580
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:22,130
不  别想
Oh, no, you don't.

1581
01:56:22,130 --> 01:56:23,810
这可不会像纽约那样
This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

1582
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:26,240
这套战甲能把绿巨人扁得求饶
This suit's already kicked the crap outta the Hulk.

1583
01:56:26,350 --> 01:56:27,840
什么  别
What? No! No!

1584
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,830
各位  幻视需要支援  马上
Guys! Vision needs backup, now!

1585
01:56:35,690 --> 01:56:37,060
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk? Hulk,

1586
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:39,060
我知道你喜欢最后时刻出场
I know you like making your entrance at the last second.

1587
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:42,460
时候到了  这已经是最后的最后时刻了
Well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.

1588
01:56:46,490 --> 01:56:48,450
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk! Hulk!

1589
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:50,040
绿巨人
Hulk!

1590
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:52,720
不
No!

1591
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:56,410
去你的  你个大绿混蛋
Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

1592
01:56:56,410 --> 01:56:57,900
我自己来
I'll do it myself!

1593
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:00,250
来吧  好啊
Come on! Yeah!

1594
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:13,940
回见
See ya!

1595
01:57:25,690 --> 01:57:27,900
绿巨人  我们有很多得谈的  哥们
Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

1596
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:41,460
我以为你很强大呢  机器
I thought you were formidable, machine.

1597
01:57:42,230 --> 01:57:44,840
但你要死了  与常人无异
But you're dying, like any man.

1598
01:57:53,420 --> 01:57:54,390
快走
Get outta here!

1599
01:57:58,150 --> 01:57:58,960
走啊
Go!

1600
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:19,030
恶心死了
That was really gross.

1601
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:47,960
我不是叫你走吗
I thought I told you to go.

1602
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:50,950
我们不以命换命  队长
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1603
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:03,960
接住你了  接住你了
I got you. I got you.

1604
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:06,720
抱歉我不记得大家的名字
I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names.

1605
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:53,840
你挺会变戏法  巫师
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1606
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:58,570
但你没用过你最强大的武器
Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.

1607
02:00:01,970 --> 02:00:03,070
假的
A fake.

1608
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:14,270
你再拿卫星砸我  我就要失控了
You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1609
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:15,900
斯塔克
Stark.

1610
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:16,920
你认识我
You know me?

1611
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:18,600
是的
I do.

1612
02:00:19,330 --> 02:00:22,140
你不是唯一背负知识诅咒的人
You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

1613
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:24,500
我唯一的诅咒就是你
My only curse is you.

1614
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:28,340
来啊
Come on!

1615
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:57,990
费这么大事  就让我留了一滴血
All that for a drop of blood.

1616
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:44,020
我尊重你  斯塔克
You have my respect, Stark.

1617
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:48,740
等我完事  还有一半人类能存活下来
When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.

1618
02:01:54,430 --> 02:01:56,120
希望他们会记得你
I hope they remember you.

1619
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:07,410
住手
Stop.

1620
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,130
饶他一命
Spare his life...

1621
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:17,710
我就把宝石给你
and I will give you the stone.

1622
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:23,090
不许耍花招
No tricks.

1623
02:02:27,790 --> 02:02:28,520
别
Don't.

1624
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:21,610
还剩一个
One to go.

1625
02:03:31,910 --> 02:03:32,840
他在哪
Where is he?

1626
02:03:42,330 --> 02:03:43,580
我们刚刚输了吗
Did we just lose?

1627
02:03:47,570 --> 02:03:48,820
你为什么要那么做
Why would you do that?

1628
02:03:52,820 --> 02:03:54,310
这是终局了
We're in the endgame now.

1629
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:21,770
你没事吧
Are you okay?

1630
02:04:24,210 --> 02:04:25,980
什么  怎么了
What? What is it?

1631
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:29,250
他来了
He's here.

1632
02:04:40,330 --> 02:04:43,300
各位  到我这里  来敌人了
Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

1633
02:04:46,170 --> 02:04:47,550
怎么回事
What the hell?

1634
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:14,730
队长
Cap.

1635
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:16,210
就是他
That's him.

1636
02:05:18,940 --> 02:05:21,480
注意  精神点
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1637
02:05:46,350 --> 02:05:47,030
旺达
Wanda.

1638
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:49,050
是时候了
It's time.

1639
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:50,340
不
No.

1640
02:05:50,660 --> 02:05:52,800
他们无法阻止他  旺达  但我们能
They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

1641
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:54,000
看着我
Look at me.

1642
02:05:54,510 --> 02:05:56,130
你有能力摧毁宝石
You have the power to destroy the stone.

1643
02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:58,050
-别  -你必须这么做  旺达  求你
- Don't. - You must do it. Wanda, please.

1644
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:02,710
我们没时间了
We are out of time.

1645
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:04,580
我不能
I can't.

1646
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:05,940
你可以的
Yes, you can.

1647
02:06:06,950 --> 02:06:07,790
你可以的
You can.

1648
02:06:09,710 --> 02:06:12,390
如果他拿到宝石  半个宇宙都会死
If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

1649
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:15,470
这不公平
It's not fair.

1650
02:06:17,230 --> 02:06:18,910
不该由你来  但就是这样
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1651
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:21,700
没事的
It's all right.

1652
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:25,000
你不会伤害我的
You could never hurt me.

1653
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:35,480
我只感觉到你
I just feel you.

1654
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:00,440
没事的
It's all right.

1655
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:11,570
没事的
It's all right.

1656
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:17,110
我爱你
I love you.

1657
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:48,510
我理解  孩子
I understand, my child.

1658
02:08:50,070 --> 02:08:51,410
比任何人都能理解
Better than anyone.

1659
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,980
你才不会懂呢
You could never.

1660
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:02,680
今天  我失去的远超你的想象
Today, I lost more than you can know.

1661
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:06,940
但现在不是哀悼的时候
But now is no time to mourn.

1662
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:13,530
现在  时间不存在了
Now is no time at all.

1663
02:09:37,390 --> 02:09:38,300
不
No!

1664
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:37,260
我说过
I told you...

1665
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,780
我会要你偿命的
you'd die for that.

1666
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:57,010
你该
You should have...

1667
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:00,810
你该
You should...

1668
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:06,450
你该砍头的
You should have gone for the head.

1669
02:11:08,670 --> 02:11:09,600
不
No!

1670
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:43,790
女儿
Daughter?

1671
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:52,820
你做到了吗
Did you do it?

1672
02:11:55,180 --> 02:11:56,110
是的
Yes.

1673
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:05,790
代价是什么
What did it cost?

1674
02:12:09,830 --> 02:12:10,870
一切
Everything.

1675
02:12:21,690 --> 02:12:22,670
你做了什么
What did you do?

1676
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:25,550
你做了什么
What'd you do?

1677
02:12:39,630 --> 02:12:40,380
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

1678
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:44,800
托尔
Thor.

1679
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:49,100
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

1680
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:50,710
史蒂夫
Steve?

1681
02:13:26,090 --> 02:13:28,320
起来  将军  起来
Up, General. Up!

1682
